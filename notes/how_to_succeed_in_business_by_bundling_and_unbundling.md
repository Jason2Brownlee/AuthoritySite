## Summary

Jim Barksdale's quote highlights two fundamental strategies for making money in business:

1. **Bundle:** The first way to make money in business is to "bundle" products, services, or offerings together. This means combining various elements into a comprehensive package that provides added value and convenience to customers. By bundling products or services, businesses can attract customers who prefer an all-in-one solution and are willing to pay a premium for the convenience and simplicity it offers.

2. **Unbundle:** The second way to make money in business is to "unbundle" existing offerings. This involves breaking down a comprehensive package into separate, individual components that customers can purchase separately. By unbundling, businesses can cater to different customer preferences and needs, allowing customers to choose only what they want or need, potentially reducing costs and expanding their market reach.

In summary, Jim Barksdale's quote suggests that businesses can effectively generate revenue by either combining and offering bundled solutions that provide added value, or by breaking down existing offerings into individual components, allowing customers to select and pay for only what they desire. These two strategies give businesses flexibility in catering to diverse customer demands and preferences, ultimately contributing to their financial success.

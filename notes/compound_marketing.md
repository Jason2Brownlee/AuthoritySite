# Note on "Compound Marketing"

* [Compound Marketing: How Smart Entrepreneurs Use Asset-Building Marketing Strategies for an Unfair Growth Advantage](https://amzn.to/3Ko8huO), Dan Norris.

The book is fine.

I probably like the concept more than the book.

Something like:

* Do compound marketing (e.g. answer all the questions).
* Each piece of content is a new door to the business.
* Content compounds overtime
	* Niche grows/internet grows (if you chose right), so it naturally gets more traffic.
	* Page rank increases as people link to it and share it.
	* Becomes more valuable as you get better at converting traffic.

This is not covered per se, but the book does have a chapter on content marketing and does talk about compounding effects. If the whole book was on this concept, it'd be more useful.

Chapters on his story, design/brand, and community were not super helpful.

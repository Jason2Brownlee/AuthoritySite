# Notes on "$100M Offers"

* [$100M Offers: How To Make Offers So Good People Feel Stupid Saying No](https://amzn.to/3ODgkq7), Alex Hormozi.

I re-read this book every few months. It's that good.

There are also a lot of great checklists at [acquisition.com](https://www.acquisition.com/)


## Chapter Notes

> This book is about how to make profitable offers. Specifically, how to reliably turn advertising dollars into (enormous) profits using a combination of pricing, value, guarantees, and naming strategies. I call the proper combination of these components: a Grand Slam Offer.

### Chapter 1. How We Got Here

Alex's story.

### Chapter 2. Grand Slam Offers

Make people an offer so good they feel stupid saying no.

> Do you want to know the secret to sales? [...] “He looked at me soberly and said: “Make people an offer so good they would feel stupid saying no. [...]

We want to help others.

> Most of us open up shop with the intention of helping people in some way. Many times, this assistance is in some way related to something that's affected us personally. We set out to “give back” by providing value to others by helping them solve a problem that once plagued us.

An offer is the thing you're selling.

> The only way to conduct business is through a value exchange, a trade of dollars for value. The offer is what initiates this trade. In a nutshell, the offer is the goods and services you agree to give or provide, how you accept payment, and the terms of the agreement.

Grand Slam Offers are carefully designed offers for the market.

> This book helps entrepreneurs craft those Grand Slam Offers. These are the offers that are so effective, profitable, and life-changing that it seems they can only be the result of luck!

### Chapter 3. Pricing: The Commodity Problem

Only 3 ways to grow a business:

1. Get more customers
2. Increase their average purchase value
3. Get them to buy more times

Don't sell a commodity, something that can be purcahsed from many places.

Sell a one of a kind. Sell a "category of one".

> Alright, let's start by defining a Grand Slam Offer. It's an offer you present to the marketplace that cannot be compared to any other product or service available, combining an attractive promotion, an unmatchable value proposition, a premium price, and an unbeatable guarantee with a money model (payment terms) that allows you to get paid to get new customers... forever removing the cash constraint on business growth.

### Chapter 4. Pricing: Finding The Right Market -- A Starving Crowd

Sell to a growing market.

> "If you were going to open a hotdog stand, and you could only have one advantage over your competitors... which would it be...?" [...] "A starving crowd."

Sell to a market with a large real pain. That has demand.

> In order to sell anything, you need demand. We are not trying to create demand. We are trying to channel it. That is a very important distinction.

Customers need purchasing power, the need money and are willing to spend it to solve their problem.

4 Indicators for a market:

1. Massive Pain
2. Purchasing Power
3. Easy to Target
4. Growing

Big 3 markets to go after:

1. Health
2. Wealth
3. Relationships

Nice down.

Pick a niche and stick to it.

The more you niche down, the more you can charge.

- Time management ($19)
- Time management for sales professionals ($99)
- Time management for outbound b2b sales ($499)
- Time management for outbound b2b power tools and gardening sales reps ($1997)

Same product, adapted and targeting different specific niches.

Pick a good market and stick to it

> The purpose of this chapter is to reinforce two things. First, don't pick a bad market. Normal markets are fine. Great markets are great. Second, once you pick, commit to it until you figure it out.

Try 100 offers, you will succeed eventually.

### Chapter 5. Pricing: Charge What It's Worth

Offer a ton of value, then charge a fair price.

> So the goal of our Grand Slam Offer will be to get more people to say yes at a higher price by increasing our value to price discrepancy. In other words, we will raise our price only after we have sufficiently increased our value.

The price of commodities is always drive down.

High price means better value, better customers, better everything.

> ...the goal is to be so much higher that a consumer thinks to themselves, "This is so much more expensive, there must be something entirely different going on here."

### Chapter 6. Value Offer: The Value Equation

The Value Equation

Value = (Dream Outcome * Perceived Likelihood of Achievement) / (Time Delay * Effort and Sacrifice)

- Maximize "Dream Outcome"
- Maximize "Perceived Likelihood of Achievement"
- Minimize "Time Delay" (make it fast)
- Minimize "Effort and Sacrifice" (make it easy)

> As you can see from the picture, there are four primary drivers of value. Two of the drivers (on top), you will seek to increase. The other two (on the bottom), you will seek to decrease.

Questions to ask:

1. What will I make? (Dream Outcome)
2. How will I know it's going to happen? (Perceived Likelihood of Achievement)
3. How long will it take? (Time Delay)
4. What is expected of me? (Effort & Sacrifice)


It is "Perceived Likelihood of Achievement" not "Likelihood of Achievement", because we cannot guarantee, but we can show that people like them have done it easily.

Always include quick wins, so they feel the speed of your solution.

> Pro Tip: Fast Wins: Always try and incorporate short-term, immediate wins for a client. Be creative. They just need to know they are on the right path and that they made the right decision trusting you and your business.

Fast beats free.

The above factors can be scored.

- We can rank and compare existing offers.
- We can design new offers.


### Chapter 7. Free Goodwill

Leave a review.

### Chapter 8. Value Offer: The Thought Process

Convergent & Divergent Thinking: One solution versus many solutions to the same problem.

Think of many.

> Every offer has building blocks, the pieces that when combined make an offer irresistible. Our goal is to use a divergent thought process to think of as many easy ways to combine these elements to provide value.


### Chapter 9. Value Offer: Creating Your Grand Slam Offer Part I: Problems & Solutions

Process:

1. Step #1: Identify Dream Outcome
2. Step #2: List Problems
3. Step #3: Solutions List
4. Step #4 Create Your Solutions Delivery Vehicles ("The How")
	This is the next chapter...
5. Step #5: Trim & Stack
	This is the next chapter...


Dream outcome, including some minimizing of time.

List out all of the problems that stop the prospect for getting the chosen dream outcome.

> So, let's go ahead and list out the problems from a prospect's perspective as you think about them. What points of friction exist for them? I like to think in the sequence that the customer will experience each of these obstacles. Again, channel insane detail (the more problems the better!).

Map each problem onto the "value equation"

1. Dream outcome cannot be achieved because... [problem]
2. The likelihood of achievement is low because... [factors]
3. Effort and sacrifice is high because... [factors]
4. Time is long because... [factors]

> Each of the above problems has four negative elements. And you guessed it, each aligns with the four value drivers as well.

Go through each problem and elaborate in extreme detail.

They are all problems that need solutions.

Transform each problem into a solution and give it a name (e.g. product name).

> Creating the solutions list has two steps. First, we are going to first transform our problems into solutions. Second, we are going to name these solutions.

It will get repetitive, which is good. Same solution can solve many subproblems.

You need to SOLVE ALL THE PROBLEMS!

> You'll also notice that a lot of them are repetitive. That's totally normal. The value drivers are the four core reasons. Our problems always relate to those drivers, and our solutions provide the needed answer to give a prospect permission to purchase. What's even crazier: is that if only one of these needs is missing in a solution, it can cause someone not to buy. You would be amazed at the reasons people do not buy. So don't limit yourself here.


### Chapter 10. Value Offer: Creating Your Grand Slam Offer Part II: Trim & Stack

Sales-Fulfillment Continuum:

- East to sell <=> Hard to sell
- Hard to fulfill <=> Easy to fulfill

We want easy to sell easy to fulfill, but there's typically a tradeoff between these concerns.

> Whenever you are building a business, you have a continuum between ease of fulfillment and ease of sales. If you lower what you have to do, it increases how hard your product or service is to sell. If you do as much as possible, it makes your product or service easy to sell but hard to fulfill because there's more demand on your time investment. The trick, and the ultimate goal, is to find a sweet spot where you sell something very well that's also easy to fulfill.


After listing solutions (previous section), we need to create the solutions.

Brainstorm all the ways to deliver each solution.

> The next step is thinking about all the things you could do to solve each of these problems you've identified. This is the most important step in this process. This is what you are going to deliver.

Can be hard to think of different ways.

Product Delivery Cheat Codes: (quoted from the book)

1. What level of personal attention do I want to provide? one-on-one, small group, one to many
2. What level of effort is expected from them? Do it themselves (DIY) - figure out how to do it on their own; do it with them (DWY) - you teach them how to do it; done for them (DFY) - you do it for them
3. If doing something live, what environment or medium do I want to deliver it in? In-person, phone support, email support, text support, Zoom support, chat support
4. If doing a recording, how do I want them to consume it? Audio, video, or written.
5.How quickly do we want to reply? On what days? during what hours? 24/7. 9-5, within 5 minutes, within an hour, within 24 hrs?
6. 10x to 1/10th test. If my customers paid me 10x my price (or $100,000) what would I provide? If they paid me 1/10th the price and I had to make my product more valuable than it already is, how would I do that? How could I still make them successful for 1/10th price? Stretch your mind in either direction and you'll come up with widely different solutions.


Next is to Trim and Stack.

Trim:
- High Cost, Low Value
- Low Cost, Low Value

Only left with high-value solutions.

> What should remain are offer items that are 1) low cost, high value and 2) high cost, high value.

Score each using the value equation from before.

Stack what is left into a high-value bundle.

Process (again):

1. Step #1: We figured out our prospective client's dream outcome.
2. Step #2: We listed out all the obstacles they're likely to encounter on their way (our opportunities for value).
3. Step #3: We listed all those obstacles as solutions.
4. Step #4: We figured out all the different ways we could deliver those solutions.
5a. Step #5a: We trimmed those ways down to only the things that were the highest value and lowest cost to us.
All we have to do now is...
5b. Step #5b: Put all the bundles together into the ultimate high value deliverable

Final bundle is a category of one and cannot be compared.

> We went through this entire process to accomplish one objective: to create a valuable offer that is differentiated and unable to be compared to anything else in the marketplace. We are selling something unique. As such, we are no longer bound by the normal pricing forces of commoditization. Prospects will now only make a value-based rather than a price-based decision on whether they should buy from us. Hoorah!”

### Chapter 11. Enhancing The Offer: Scarcity, Urgency, Bonuses, Guarantees, and Naming

Supply and demand curves.

> Fundamentally, all marketing exists to influence the supply and demand curve.

1. Increase demand through marketing.
2. Increased demand means we can sell more units.
3. Decrease supply to charge more for those units.

> Therefore, if we seek to increase the demand (or desire), we must decrease or delay satisfying the desires of our prospects.

> Hormozi Law: The longer you delay the ask, the bigger the ask you can make. “The longer the runway, the bigger the plane that can take off.

Use techniques to enhance the offer (quoted):

1. Use scarcity to decrease supply to raise prices (and indirectly increase demand through perceived exclusiveness)
2. Use urgency to increase demand by decreasing the action threshold of a prospect.
3. Use bonuses to increase demand (and increase perceived exclusivity).
4. Use guarantees to increase demand by reversing risk.
5. Use names to re-stimulate demand and expand awareness of my offer to my target audience.

### Chapter 12. Enhancing The Offer: Scarcity

Scarcity is the most powerful method.

Three types of scarcity (limited quantity):

1. Limited Supply of Seats/Slots: in general or over X period of time.
2. Limited Supply of Bonuses
3. Never available again.

> Employ one or multiple methods of scarcity in your business. You will drive a faster purchasing decision from your prospects, and at higher prices. Just let them know your limits and let psychology do the rest.


### Chapter 13. Enhancing The Offer: Urgency

> Urgency is a function of time.

Types:

1. Cohort-Based Rolling Urgency
2. Rolling Seasonal Urgency
3. Pricing or Bonus-Based Urgency
4. Exploding Opportunity

> Adding a deadline and incorporating one or multiple forms of urgency will get more people to take action than would otherwise. I have employed all four of these methods with great effectiveness.

Have a limited time offer with the old price, each time prices are increased.


### Chapter 14. Enhancing The Offer: Bonuses

Split up the offer and value each.

> The main point I want you to take away from this is that a single offer is less valuable than the same offer broken into its component parts and stacked as bonuses

Describe them well, bonus bullets.

Add other peoples products as bonuses.

> We want to employ bonuses because they expand the price to value discrepancy and get people to purchase who otherwise wouldn't. They massively increase the prospects' perception of the value of our offer.

### Chapter 15. Enhancing The Offer: Guarantees

Reduce risk. Add a guarantee.

Types of Guarantees:

1. Unconditional (no questions)
2. Conditional (some limitations, like time)
3. Anti-Guarantee (no guarantee)
4. Implied Guarantees (performance-based payment)

Stack guarantees.

Describe the guarantees well.




### Chapter 16. Enhancing The Offer: Naming

# Success

I've had some success with authority sites over the years.

This is boasting (yuck!), but it confirms that I have some idea of what I'm talking about.

I have:

* Written 1,500+ of pieces of content / tutorials.
* Published 30+ technical books.
* Received many millions of pageviews per month.
* Sold many millions of dollars of digital products.
* Exited for many millions of dollars.

Some of my sites over the years:

* [CleverAlgorithms](https://web.archive.org/web/20130120074424/CleverAlgorithms.com) ([archived](https://github.com/clever-algorithms/CleverAlgorithms))
* [MobileGameEngines](https://web.archive.org/web/20131108154500/http://mobilegameengines.com/) ([archived](https://github.com/Jason2Brownlee/MobileGameEngines))
* [MachineLearningMastery](https://MachineLearningMastery.com) (sold)
* [SuperFastPython](https://SuperFastPython.com) (current)

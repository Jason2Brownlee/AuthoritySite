# Notes on "12 Months to $1 Million"

* [12 Months to $1 Million: How to Pick a Winning Product, Build a Real Business, and Become a Seven-Figure Entrepreneur](https://amzn.to/3OVrsP9), Ryan Moran.

The book is really about selling real products on Amazon (perhaps a "Fulfillment by Amazon" aka FBA business). Nevertheless, if we substitute the product with "book" or the distribution channel with "your website store", then the ideas can be helpful.

## Chapter Summary

Ideas I've puled out from each chapter.

### Foreword by Russell Brunson

Book aims to be a one among few.

> About once a decade, a book comes along that sparks new ideas for dreamers like us. That book throws open the doors for entrepreneurs, and it encourages dreamers to get off the sidelines and begin their quest for freedom. In the past, books like Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki, The 4-Hour Work Week by Tim Ferriss, and Crush It! by Gary Vaynerchuk inspired a new generation of business owners; these books are considered classics because they continue to inspire entrepreneurs to this day. I believe that the book you are reading right now—12 Months to $1 Million by Ryan Daniel Moran—is the next classic for this generation of entrepreneurs.



### Preface: Don't Read This Book

Business is way hard, and not for everyone.

> This book's roadmap is so effective it can turn even the moderately curious—the window-shoppers, if you will—into successful entrepreneurs. If you casually go down this road, and you commit to the plan within these pages, you may very well find yourself quickly responsible for a million-dollar business. I don't use the word “responsible” lightly. I wouldn't wish entrepreneurship on anyone who's not cut out for it or dedicated to the amount of work it takes.


### Introduction

Repeatable method.

> I realized, This method works. It's scalable. It's repeatable. And big businesses want to buy what it creates.

Formula

> If you have three to five products, at an average price point of $30 per unit, each selling twenty-five to thirty units per day, you have a million-dollar business.

* 5 * 25 = 125 products per day
* 125 * $30 = $3,750 per day
* $3,750 * 365 = $1,368,750 per year

Fair enough.

It is so hard

> Becoming and succeeding as an entrepreneur is a lot like parenting. I can tell you that it's hard; you can read books—like this one—that explain all the pitfalls and provide all the tips; but at the end of the day, you just cannot imagine how difficult it will be.

Incremental improvement in the right direction compounds

> One of my favorite books is called The Slight Edge by Jeff Olson. In it, he argues that extraordinary results do not come from big wins—they come from incremental steps forward that compound over time. For instance, you don't get fat by overeating one time; you get fat when you consistently overeat.



### Chapter 1: The Landscape of Opportunity

Distribution is equalized, e.g. amazon/shopify

Big brand by small brands to get new products / categories.

Leverage "identity marketing", e.g. influences, and even microinfluences (joint venture deal).




### Chapter 2: The Mindset of a Seven-Figure Entrepreneur

Take ownership.

It's hard!

> This game requires you to carry the load on your shoulders and press on in the face of fear. Whether it's your first business or your hundredth, you're going to ask yourself the same questions at some point: Is this going to fall apart? Am I going to be found out as a fraud? Did one of my competitors already come up with a better version of this? That little voice breaks most people. True-born entrepreneurs move through it because they've been working through fear their whole lives.


### Chapter 3: Step One: Choose Your Customer

Pick a customer first.

> That's why, when someone asks me, “What product should I sell?” or “How do I sell more product?” I always answer, “Decide who your customer is first.

Help real people.
Sell to real people.

> You can sell things and make money, and your business will be purely transactional. You can follow a formula that produces profits, and it can work for a while. But once you start thinking about people, you start building a real business. If you create something that people actually want, and you communicate to the person, you can create a million-dollar business in one year. That's how you become a real entrepreneur.

People buy from other people.
People trust brands.
Develop a brand, not a product.

> When you start with people and create products for them, you become a price setter, not a price follower. That gives you better profit margins. And you get repeat customers, rather than one-off sales.

Do research about the people you want to serve.
They are already using products, and have problems with those products.

Brainstorm a suite of products you can sell your people

> Once you've thought of a target person and are brainstorming at least three to five products that make up your brand, your next step is to start narrowing down the first product you'll sell. I call this the “gateway product” because it's the first in a series of products you'll eventually sell. I like to ask the question, “What product will make my target customer want to buy more from me in the future?

Foundational Questions

* To whom are you going to sell?
* What do they already buy?
* Which product out of that suite of products do you want to focus on, to either make a great version of it or a version that solves one of their problems?
* What does your group think about similar products on the market?
* Where does your person hang out with others?
* Do you know how you will get predictable sales?
* What will be products two, three, and four?


### Chapter 4: Step Two: Develop Your First Product

n/a - physical product stuff

### Chapter 5: Step Three: Funding Your Business

n/a - inventory stuff, source of funding stuff

### Chapter 6: Step Four: Stack the Deck

Build an audience.

Facebook group.
Email list.

Collect pre-orders.
An audience to which you can launch.

> You just need enough eyeballs to put the cards in your favor.

Just start.

> If we wanted to make earning money really simple, we could boil it down to two steps: pick something to sell and sell it. Most people never make it through the first step of deciding what to sell. Instead, they sell their time in the form of a 9-to-5 job.

Need to get reviews, start to game amazon raking system

> Your only goal at the end of the eight weeks, on launch day, is to have enough of a following to be able to move the first few hundred units of your product. That way, you can get that snowball rolling and get to twenty-five sales a day.

Need 100 buyers

> Theoretically, 100 people in the same room, ready to buy on launch day, would be enough to start the fire.

My guess: perhaps 10,000 email list, with 1% conversion?

> 1,000 followers + 10 personal contacts + 1 influencer = 100 sales

Stack the deck

* Identify where your target market already hangs out.
* Create a series of content directly targeted to that person.
* Document the process of your product.
* Start announcing when the product is going to be available.
* Reach out to your own personal contacts and start lining up that one influencer.
* Finally, build your hot list


### Chapter 7: Step Five: Launching Your First Product

It's very cool when strangers buy your products.

> When you see that new, unrecognized, unfamiliar name, you’ll grin. You’ll look at your partner, or your mom, or your dog, and you’ll say, in a whisper at first, “I think I just made a real sale." That’s when you’re really in business.

Do all the things.
Keep working hard.
Focus on small wins, each day. They build up.

> In this stage of the process, every sale is vital, and every social share or review is a potential game changer. It’s your job to ensure that the momentum doesn’t die after those first, exciting sales. It’s your job to keep stoking that fire, and every inch gets stretched into a mile. That means winning over every customer, going above and beyond to your followers, and earning every review.


### Chapter 8: Step Six: Growing to Twenty-Five Sales a Day

Develop a series of products for your customer.

> Think about a series of products that serve the same person: That’s the power of a brand.

Things happen on amazon at 25 reviews and 100 reviews.

> For example, you will see a major bump when you cross twenty-five positive reviews. And you’ll see a bigger bump when you cross the 100-review mark because that means you’re the real thing. There is something about seeing 100 people approve your product that crosses the bullshit detector in people’s brains.

How to get unstuck

* Use Amazon’s pay-per-click platform
* Run video ads on Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube
* Put attention back into building your community

Never stop.

> In fact, you never stop repeating the process. You go back to where all your customers showed up, and you engage even more.

### Chapter 9: Step Seven: Build a Million-Dollar Brand

Now do more of the same.

> Your task is simple: Release more products as quickly as you can comfortably handle, without getting distracted.

Product 2 must be a new product, not an extension of first product.

> The biggest mistake people make is trying to pursue a second niche market with their next product. Your second product is always the answer to this question: What’s the next thing that my first customer would want to buy?

Become a brand that customers keep buying from.

> Customers will switch products, but they don’t often switch brands. A brand is just outsourced trust. It’s an expensive risk to try something new, which is why it’s so hard to get a business off the ground. Once you build that trust and validation, people will continue to buy from you. Someone else promoting awareness about your products only helps your brand. Stay in your lane, and don’t let their decisions determine where you go as a company.

You will have a hero product (eventually) that brings everyone in.

> However, your “hero” product, the flagship your brand becomes known for, may not be the first product you release, or even the second. I’ve seen examples in which the first product did fine, the second did fine, but the third just took off. It’s impossible to know which product will most resonate.

Stay on target!

> Always keep in mind your central goal: to build a million-dollar business in one year. To do this, you need three to five products, each earning twenty-five sales a day, at a $30 price point. That’s it. Your only goal after launch is to get to twenty-five sales a day, which unlocks the next product, which then unlocks the next. Keep focusing on that momentum, and the snowball will roll all the way down the hill.

### Chapter 10: Step Eight: Getting to $100k per Month and Beyond

You need distribution, an audience, a way to reach your audience.

> To build a million-dollar business, you need three things:
> 1. A place to take sales, whether that’s Amazon, your own store, Kickstarter, or a combination of all three
> 2. A stacked deck with a small following to whom you can launch products
> 3. A way to expose your products to new audiences

You can also use micro-influencers:

> “Most people overlook the power of micro-influencers, but they can create a cascade of effects that will completely change your brand.

How to value a $1M business (dubious...I would use gross sales in 1 calendar year)

> Here’s the rule of thumb: If you sustain an average of $100,000 or more for three months, you’re a million-dollar business. End of debate.

## Chapter Notes

### 1. Passion Is Everything

Passion!

> Are you willing to do whatever it takes for the chance to live entirely on your own terms? If so, you're lucky. You're lucky because you live in an age of unmatched opportunity for anyone with enough hustle, patience, and big dreams.

Love what you do.

> Live your passion. What does that mean, anyway? It means that when you get up for work every morning, every single morning, you are pumped because you get to talk about or work with or do the thing that interests you the most in the world. You don't live for vacations because you don't need a break from what you're doing—working, playing, and relaxing are one and the same. You don't even pay attention to how many hours you're working because to you, it's not really work. You're making money, but you'd do whatever it is you're doing for free.

> It's never a bad time to start a business unless you're starting a mediocre business.

> Learn to live your passion, and you'll have all the money you need plus total control over your own destiny. That's a pretty comfortable place to be, wouldn't you say?

### 2. Success Is in Your DNA

> I've been dying to do this book, not because I think I can help everyone who wants to become a millionaire—although I'm pretty sure I can—but because it drives me crazy to know that there are still people out there who haven't figured out that they don't have to settle.

> Storytelling is by far the most underrated skill in business.

> Developing your personal brand is key to monetizing your passion online.

> Consumers want you to tell them the truth. Sure, they want quality and service and value and entertainment, but above all they want to know that the person they're dealing with is being honest.

> Developing your personal brand is the same thing as living and breathing your résumé every second that you're working.


### 3. Build Your Personal Brand

n/a

### 4. A Whole New World

> My feeling is that no matter how much you like your job, you should aim to leave it and grow your own brand and business or partner with someone to do so, because as long as you're working for someone else you will never be living entirely true to yourself and your passion.

### 5. Create Great Content

> You can hustle and market and network all you want, but if your sports drink tastes like trash, or if you're putting out bad information, you're going to lose.

> Do your homework. You should be reading and absorbing every single resource you can find—books, trade journals, newsletters, websites, as well as taking classes and attending lectures and conferences

> You can monetize any passion, but the level at which you can monetize will be affected by the size of your niche and whether you are able to differentiate yourself enough from the other players in it.

> the lure and the lasso. You're going to work your content in two ways. The first is as a lure, creating it, posting it, and allowing people to come to you as they discover it. The second is to use it as a lasso through comments on other people's content that relates to yours, inserting yourself into existing conversations and actively creating reasons for your audience to come to you.



### 6. Choose Your Platform

n/a

### 7. Keep It Real...Very Real

Work Hard!

> I've also said that in order to crush it you have to be sure your content is the best in its category. You can still make plenty of good money if you're fourth best in a category, or ninth best, but if you really want to dominate the competition and make big bucks, you've got to be the best. Do that, be that, and no one will be able to touch you. With one exception. Someone with less passion and talent and poorer content can totally beat you if they're willing to work longer and harder than you are. Hustle is it. Without it, you should just pack up your toys and go home.

> The cool thing about hustle, though, is that it's one more thing that equalizes the playing field.

It take a lot of time.

> You don't build businesses in six weeks, or two months, or six months.


### 8. Create Community: Digging Your Internet Trench

> Every subject, no matter how small, has an Internet trench. You need to find it (googling is a way to start).

Lead.

> Your long-term goal is to get sticky and create more and more opportunities to communicate. Your audience joins your fan page. They comment on your blog. They tweet and tumble your posts. And slowly but surely their friends take notice, and start doing the same, and their friends take notice, and suddenly your little community of one explodes into a major metropolis.


### 9. The Best Marketing Strategy Ever

> Care.

### 10. Make the World Listen

> Any topic can be turned into a profitable, sustainable social-media-driven business

Steps...

> Make sure you have a big fat button on your site that says, “Want to Do Business with Me?” or something along those lines.

> One of my favorite mantras is “Anything is better than zero,” but true to my contradictory nature, let me just say that the longer you hold out to monetize your blog, the better.

### 11. Start Monetizing

Killer idea:

> Go to Google.com, search your subject matter, and check every blog and website to see which companies pay for Google AdSense ads to be posted. Cold-call every relevant company that is buying space on Google AdSense—they're already spending the ad money on the Web, why not spend it on you?


### 12. Roll with It

Adapt or die.

> You'd be surprised at how many entrepreneurs aren't good at adjusting to changing environments, and it's a major reason why so many businesses don't achieve their full potential.


### 13. Legacy Is Greater Than Currency

> How you build your business is so much more important than how much you make while doing it.

> Legacy is the mortar of successful, lasting brands.

### Conclusion: The Time Is Now, the Message Is Forever

> The Internet is as powerful as oxygen, but we have not seen its full capabilities. It's got a long way to go, and it's going to morph and change and reveal all kinds of surprises. You've got to be prepared to evolve and adapt along with it.

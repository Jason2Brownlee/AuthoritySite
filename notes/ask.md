## Deep Dive Survey

According to Ryan Levesque in his book "Ask," a "deep dive survey" is a powerful tool to gain valuable insights into your audience's needs, desires, and preferences. The survey should consist of open-ended questions that encourage respondents to provide detailed and meaningful answers. Here are some key questions you can include in a deep dive survey:

1. **"What is your single biggest challenge when it comes to [topic/niche]?"** This question helps identify the primary pain points and obstacles your audience is facing.

2. **"What have you tried so far to overcome this challenge, and what were the results?"** This question provides insight into their previous attempts at finding solutions and their level of experience.

3. **"What is your ideal outcome or goal related to [topic/niche]?"** This question helps understand their aspirations and what they hope to achieve.

4. **"What do you value most when it comes to [product/service/niche]?"** This question explores the factors that are most important to them when considering a product or service.

5. **"What would you like to learn more about or see improved in [topic/niche]?"** This question uncovers potential areas for improvement or topics they are interested in learning more about.

6. **"What type of content do you prefer (e.g., blog posts, videos, webinars) and why?"** This question helps tailor content delivery to their preferences.

7. **"Which brands or products do you admire and why?"** Understanding their preferred brands provides insights into their values and preferences.

8. **"What is your biggest fear or concern about [topic/niche]?"** This question reveals any apprehensions or doubts they may have.

9. **"How do you prefer to consume information or make purchasing decisions?"** This question helps understand their decision-making process.

10. **"Is there anything else you'd like to share that I haven't asked about?"** This open-ended question allows respondents to provide additional insights or comments that may not have been covered in the previous questions.

The key to a successful deep dive survey is to keep it focused on your niche or topic, use open-ended questions, and encourage respondents to share their thoughts and experiences in detail. Analyzing the survey responses can provide valuable data for tailoring your marketing messages, creating relevant offers, and better serving your audience's needs.

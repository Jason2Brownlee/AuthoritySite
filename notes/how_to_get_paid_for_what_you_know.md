> Without an audience, nothing is possible. But with an audience, anything is possible.

> It doesn't take any strategy or intelligence to just work all the time. It takes way more creativity and diligence to stop doing #AllTheThings, evaluate what activities in your business actually lead to more consistent sales, and then do only those things.

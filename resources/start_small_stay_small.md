# Notes on "Start Small, Stay Small"

* [Start Small, Stay Small: A Developer's Guide to Launching a Startup](https://amzn.to/3YhpcVx), Rob Walling.

I've read this book a ton. Might have been one of the first books I read on my journey. A classic for sure. The early parts of the book are the most useful. Mindset, market, etc.

I also join his "Micropreneur Academy". The accountability room was the most valuable part for me.

### Chapter 1: The Chasm Between Developer and Entrepreneur

> What is an Entrepreneur? An entrepreneur is a visionary. He is the person who sees the potential in an idea and creates a viable business from nothing.

> Micropreneurs – Entrepreneurs who want to remain solo.

> Bootstrappers – A bootstrapper has their vision set on something larger than a single person venture.

A Look at the Self-Funded Startup Entrepreneur

* Point 1: An entrepreneur is a technical visionary who creates software for a niche market.
* Point 2: An entrepreneur merges existing technical knowledge with online marketing knowledge.
* Point 3: An entrepreneur is a cross between a developer, a webmaster, and a marketer.

Product is the easy part for a developer, marketing is the hard part. Get that right first.

> Product Last. Marketing First.

Funded from sweat and revenues, not investment.

> Self-funding your startup is worlds apart from what most people talk about in the tech startup world.

WRONG reasons (to start):

* Reason #1: Having a Product Idea
* Reason #2: To Get Rich
* Reason #3: Because It Sounds Like Fun

> Micropreneurs lean towards lifestyle choices (freedom, income independence, location independence)

Figure out what you want and write it down.

Biggest roadblocks:

* Roadblock #1: No Market
* Roadblock #2: Fear
* Roadblock #3: Lack of Goals
* Roadblock #4: Inconsistency
* Roadblock #5: Believing You Have to Do Everything Yourself

Calculate your effective hourly rate.

Outsource the small stuff. Practice it. Get good at it.

Software is just one part.

> Software development is a subset of the skills an entrepreneur needs to launch and operate a successful startup.

* Realization #1: Being a Good Technician is Not Enough
* Realization #2: Market Comes First, Marketing Second, Aesthetic Third, and Functionality a Distant Fourth
* Realization #3: Things Will Never Be As Clear As You Want Them to Be
* Realization #4: You Can’t Specify Everything...But You Do Need a Plan
* Realization #6: You Will Never Be Done
* Realization #7: Don’t Expect Instant Gratification
* Realization #8: Process is King
* Realization #9: Nothing about a Startup is a One-Time Effort

> But you will never feel “done.”

### Chapter 2: Why Niches are the Name of the Game

Market First Approach:

> Market comes first, marketing second, aesthetic third, and functionality a distant fourth

> The product with a sizable market and low competition wins even with bad marketing, a bad aesthetic, and poor functionality.

Aim for a tiny market and be best in class.

> If you choose a niche market and focus so tightly that your product becomes the best in class, members of that niche will have no choice but to use your product.

Reasons to niche down:

* Reason #1: A Niche Requires You to Narrow Your Product Focus
* Reason #2: Niche Advertising is more Cost Effective
* Reason #3: Niches Have Less Competition
* Reason #4: Niches Have Higher Profit Margins
* Reason #5: Niche Markets Are Not Used to Good Marketing
* Reason #6: It’s Easier for Prospects to Trust You


> Owning the majority of a $500,000/year market is enough to support a very profitable startup, especially one that’s taken no outside funding.

> In general, since niche markets are small they have less competition, and less competition means you are able to charge more for your product, resulting in higher margins.

> Niche markets are typically pursued by small players; players who don’t have the marketing expertise (or the manpower) of large companies.

Lots of ideas on finding a niche.

> The Best Niches are Reserved for People Who Do Something

> As a self-funded startup you want a market that is already looking for your product, even if it doesn‟t exist.

You must have a way to reach the market.

> The second question you need to ask about a potential market is: how will you reach them in an inexpensive, sustainable manner?

Aim for a vertical market (specific industry) no a horizontal market (cuts across industries).

* Reason #1: Members of a Vertical Have Similar Behavior
* Reason #2: Members of a Vertical Talk to One Another
* Reason #3: Members of a Vertical “Hang out” Together
* Reason #4: Members of a Vertical Have Similar Needs

Estimate sales for niche.

* visitors/mo * conversion rate * price of product = revenue per month
* 1,000 visitors x .05 x $10 = $500

> If your price point is in what I refer to as the consumer range of $1 to $50 and your product is priced appropriately for your market, your conversion rate should be between 1% and 4%.
> If you’re priced between $50 and $1,000 or offer recurring pricing and your product is priced appropriately for your market, you’ll most likely convert between 0.5% and 2%.

Lots of keyword tools, used to estimate demand for above equation.

Now do a test!

Called the "Mini Sales Site", based on approach in the 4HWW book (tim ferriss).

> The idea behind this approach is that if you ask visitors whether or not they would buy your product, you will wind up with inaccurate data. The only way you know if someone would try or buy your product is if they think they are really trying or buying it when they visit your sales site.

Buy ads and drive traffic to mock sales page. Check conversion rates.

> The mini sales site approach works best if you are selling a downloadable or web-based (SaaS) application.

A series of steps on how to setup a test site and google adwords campaign.

> After sending 100-200 visitors to your site, look at the numbers of “trials” or “purchases.” Assume you will convert between 2% and 5% of people who clicked “try now” or “download free trial.” Assume 40% of the people who clicked “buy now” would have completed the purchase.

> While this approach cannot provide you with 100% certainty that your idea will succeed or fail, it forces you to take the next step towards launching your product.

### Chapter 3: Your Product

Product Success Triangle (1/3 of focus on each):

1. Product - Your product has to be good
2. Market - You need a group of people willing to pay money for it
3. Execution – You have to market, sell, and support it

Focus on market and execution to start.

> You should aim to master all three in the long-term but at the start, place emphasis on the latter two to determine if the idea will fly.

Build it or hire people to build it.

Price correctly.

> Determining your price is one of the most challenging aspects of launching a product.

Types of products.

### Chapter 4: Building a Killer Sales Website

The website is a sales funnel.

Goal is to get them on your email list to warm them up, then offer the sale.

> You shouldn't plan to sell to a customer on their first visit

Become an authority for the niche.

> The answer is: an audience of readers who will return again and again, perusing and thinking about the product until it’s embedded in their brain. After this kind of exposure, it will always be their first choice should they ever need source control, bug tracking, or project management software.

Turn visitors into prospects.

> Your number one goal, even beyond selling your product, is turning browsers into prospects.

Customer avatar.

Have clear calls to action, e.g. take tour, free version, free download, etc.

Each page has one CTA.

> In a successful sales website, every page has a single, primary call to action. That is, an action you want your user to take.

A "sales website", to sell the software.

Lots of tips.

Do email marketing, e.g. autoresponder. Warm up the prospect into a buyer.

Lots of other ideas for email marketing.



### Chapter 5: Startup Marketing

A surge from hacker news will not result in sales. They are not in your niche.

> Many approaches will not work in your market.

> High quality traffic means each visitor is very close to your ideal customer and they know and trust you

Don't rely on PPC.

Develop a blog (or podcast / youtube channel). Become an authority.

Get really good at SEO.

Lots of suggestions.

### Chapter 6: Virtual Assistants and Outsourcing 181

Use VAs.

> Outsourcing to a virtual assistant will dramatically reduce the time you need to spend on administrative tasks, and increase the time you can commit to growing your business.

Lots of tips.

### Chapter 7: Grow it or Start Over

Now what?

1. Grow it, or
2. Create a new product

Growing means moving from early adopters to the rest of the (niche) market.

> Most startups that achieve early success find themselves in the chasm. That place Geoffrey Moore talks about in his seminal work Crossing the Chasm, where early adopters are using your product and you are trying to solve the puzzle to get to mass adoption.

Lots of tips.

Automate the business before moving on.

Hire someone to run it.
Sell it.

Build a portfolio of products:

* Advantage #1: The Ability to Choose Small Niches
* Advantage #2: Income Diversification
* Advantage #3: Attention Diversification
* Advantage #4: Economies of Scale
* Advantage #5: You Can Focus on What You Enjoy
* Advantage #6: Experience Transfers

> By having a product portfolio (a collection of products owned by a Serial Micropreneur) you diversify your income, and thus diversify your risk.

Lots of pitfalls from having a portfolio.

> Here is the formula for Serial Micropreneurship:
> 1. Build or buy a product
> 2. Launch or revamp it
> 3. Grow revenue to its natural plateau
> 4. Outsource and automate ruthlessly
> 5. Goto step 1

Lots of advice on selling.

> Automating your startup should be your first choice. But if you are unable or unwilling to do so, getting a lump-sum payment through a sale can be an appealing option.

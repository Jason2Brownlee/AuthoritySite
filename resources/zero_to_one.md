# Notes on "Zero to One"

* [Zero to One: Notes on Start Ups, or How to Build the Future](https://amzn.to/3qaXey2), Peter Thiel.

## Summary

"Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future" by Peter Thiel is a book that offers insights into entrepreneurship, innovation, and building successful startups. Thiel, a successful entrepreneur and investor, shares his views on creating unique businesses that go from zero to a monopoly position (one). Here are the main points summarized:

1. **Monopoly and Competition:** Thiel advocates for building a monopoly or a highly unique business that offers something different from competitors. Monopolies have the potential for outsized success compared to competitive businesses.

2. **Innovation and Technology:** Successful startups should focus on creating innovative technology that transforms industries and offers significant advantages over existing solutions.

3. **Defining a Valuable Niche:** Entrepreneurs should focus on finding and dominating a specific niche or market, rather than competing in broad, crowded industries.

4. **First-Mover Advantage:** Being the first to market with a new and disruptive product or service can give a startup a significant advantage.

5. **Vertical Progression:** Instead of horizontal expansion into similar markets, aim for vertical progression by dominating a specific market and then expanding into adjacent areas.

6. **Secrets and Intellectual Property:** Great startups are built on unique insights and secrets that competitors don't understand or have access to.

7. **Sales and Marketing:** Focus on creating a compelling narrative and message that resonates with customers, rather than relying solely on traditional sales and marketing tactics.

8. **Talent and Team Building:** Building a strong and complementary team is essential for success. The right team can leverage each other's strengths and contribute to the company's vision.

9. **Long-Term Vision:** Successful startups have a clear long-term vision and are committed to achieving it despite challenges and setbacks.

10. **Start Small and Scale:** Begin by dominating a small market before scaling up to larger markets and audiences.

11. **Value Creation:** Aim to create significant value for customers, employees, and shareholders.

12. **Future-Orientation:** Look towards the future and anticipate how industries and technologies will evolve to stay ahead of the competition.

"Zero to One" provides valuable advice for entrepreneurs and business leaders looking to create innovative and transformative startups. By focusing on monopoly-building, unique insights, and vertical progress, entrepreneurs can create companies that thrive and shape the future of industries.


## Chapter Summaries

### Preface: Zero to One

> Doing what we already know how to do takes the world from 1 to n, adding more of something familiar. But every time we create something new, we go from 0 to 1. The act of creation is singular, as is the moment of creation, and the result is something fresh and strange.

> Zero to One is about how to build companies that create new things.

### 1 The Challenge of the Future

> “What important truth do very few people agree with you on?”

Aim for vertical progress. New things.

> When we think about the future, we hope for a future of progress. That progress can take one of two forms. Horizontal or extensive progress means copying things that work—going from 1 to n. Horizontal progress is easy to imagine because we already know what it looks like. Vertical or intensive progress means doing new things—going from 0 to 1. Vertical progress is harder to imagine because it requires doing something nobody else has ever done.

We need new technology.

> In a world of scarce resources, globalization without new technology is unsustainable.

New teach only comes from new companies.

> New technology tends to come from new ventures—startups

> Positively defined, a startup is the largest group of people you can convince of a plan to build a different future.

### 2 Party Like It’s 1999

Lessons:

1. Make incremental advances
2. Stay lean and flexible
3. Improve on the competition
4. Focus on product, not sales

They are all totally wrong!

> And yet the opposite principles are probably more correct:
> 1. It is better to risk boldness than triviality.
> 2. A bad plan is better than no plan.
> 3. Competitive markets destroy profits.
> 4. Sales matters just as much as product.

### 3 All Happy Companies Are Different

> what valuable company is nobody building?

> “Perfect competition” is considered both the ideal and the default state in Economics 101.

Competition is death.

> Under perfect competition, in the long run no company makes an economic profit.

We need the opposite: monopoly.

> The opposite of perfect competition is monopoly. Whereas a competitive firm must sell at the market price, a monopoly owns its market, so it can set its own prices. Since it has no competition, it produces at the quantity and price combination that maximizes its profits.

Bad monopolies are obviously bad:

> In a static world, a monopolist is just a rent collector. If you corner the market for something, you can jack up the price; others will have no choice but to buy from you.

Monopoly is better for business and employees. Also better for customers and society.

> Creative monopolists give customers more choices by adding entirely new categories of abundance to the world. Creative monopolies aren’t just good for the rest of society; they’re powerful engines for making it better.

All good business are a monopoly (of what though...).

> Monopoly is therefore not a pathology or an exception. Monopoly is the condition of every successful business.

### 4 The Ideology of Competition

> CREATIVE MONOPOLY means new products that benefit everybody and sustainable profits for the creator. Competition means no profits for anybody, no meaningful differentiation, and a struggle for survival.

People believe the opposite. This is ideology.

This starts in school, which is super competitive.

> Our educational system both drives and reflects our obsession with competition.

Competition is also bad for ideas.

> Competition can make people hallucinate opportunities where none exist.

### 5 Last Mover Advantage

How to value a business.

> Simply stated, the value of a business today is the sum of all the money it will make in the future.

Tech companies take a long time to be valuable.

> Technology companies follow the opposite trajectory. They often lose money for the first few years: it takes time to build valuable things, and that means delayed revenue. Most of a tech company’s value will come at least 10 to 15 years in the future.

Short term thinking is fatal in tech companies.

> If you focus on near-term growth above all else, you miss the most important question you should be asking: will this business still be around a decade from now?

Monopolies share 3 features:

> Every monopoly is unique, but they usually share some combination of the following characteristics: proprietary technology, network effects, economies of scale, and branding.

Start with a small monopoly, then expand.

> Every startup is small at the start. Every monopoly dominates a large share of its market. Therefore, every startup should start with a very small market. Always err on the side of starting too small.

Must have customers.

> The perfect target market for a startup is a small group of particular people concentrated together and served by few or no competitors.

Nice-up later.

> Once you create and dominate a niche market, then you should gradually expand into related and slightly broader markets.

Do not disrupt, this is competing.

> Indeed, if your company can be summed up by its opposition to already existing firms, it can’t be completely new and it’s probably not going to become a monopoly.

Don't aim to be a first-mover, be a last-mover.

> It’s much better to be the last mover—that is, to make the last great development in a specific market and enjoy years or even decades of monopoly profits. The way to do that is to dominate a small niche and scale up from there, toward your ambitious long-term vision.

### 6 You Are Not a Lottery Ticket

Success is not luck.

> If you believe your life is mainly a matter of chance, why read this book?

Have a firm or "definite" idea of the future, then make it happen.

> You can expect the future to take a definite form or you can treat it as hazily uncertain. If you treat the future as something definite, it makes sense to understand it in advance and to work to shape it. But if you expect an indefinite future ruled by randomness, you’ll give up on trying to master it.

Focus.

> A definite view, by contrast, favors firm convictions. Instead of pursuing many-sided mediocrity and calling it “well-roundedness,” a definite person determines the one best thing to do and then does it.

Be a "definite optimist", you can see the future and its awesome.

> To a definite optimist, the future will be better than the present if he plans and works to make it better.

The recent history has been dominated by "indefinite optimist", they think things will be great, but know idea how. This is dangerous.

> A business with a good definite plan will always be underrated in a world where people see the future as random.

Take control of the future by starting a company.

> A startup is the largest endeavor over which you can have definite mastery. You can have agency not just over your own life, but over a small and important part of the world. It begins by rejecting the unjust tyranny of Chance. You are not a lottery ticket.

### 7 Follow the Money

Think in terms of power laws (e.g. 80/20).

Venture capital follows a power law. Diversification is not good enough.

> But this “spray and pray” approach usually produces an entire portfolio of flops, with no hits at all. This is because venture returns don’t follow a normal distribution overall. Rather, they follow a power law: a small handful of companies radically outperform all others.

You have to only pick winners (impossible?).

> only invest in companies that have the potential to return the value of the entire fund

Portfolio of potential winners.

> Of course, no one can know with certainty ex ante which companies will succeed, so even the best VC firms have a “portfolio.” However, every single company in a good venture portfolio must have the potential to succeed at vast scale.

We have to pick this way too.

We invest time, and we must pick winners, but serially, not a concurrent portfolio.

> An entrepreneur makes a major investment just by spending her time working on a startup. Therefore every entrepreneur must think about whether her company is going to succeed and become valuable. Every individual is unavoidably an investor, too. When you choose a career, you act on your belief that the kind of work you do will be valuable decades from now.

You must go all in.

Even picking the right company to work at is important, more so than starting something new, if it is the "right thing".

> The power law means that differences between companies will dwarf the differences in roles inside companies.


### 8 Secrets

> what important truth do very few people agree with you on?

> what valuable company is nobody building?

Every company is built around a secret that is not widely know or believed.

There are secrets left.

Not all the good ideas have been done.

We're all put off because of incrementalism, risk aversion, complacency and flatness.

You must believe in secrets.

My must find secrets, then build a company around them.

> Great companies can be built on open but unsuspected secrets about how the world works.

Two kinds of secrets:

> There are two kinds of secrets: secrets of nature and secrets about people. Natural secrets exist all around us; to find them, one must study some undiscovered aspect of the physical world. Secrets about people are different: they are things that people don’t know about themselves or things they hide because they don’t want others to know.

Go for people secrets:

> Secrets about people are relatively underappreciated. Maybe that’s because you don’t need a dozen years of higher education to ask the questions that uncover them: What are people not allowed to talk about? What is forbidden or taboo?

Tell the right people, build a company around it.

Opposite of a cult (a good idea, instead of a bad idea)

> every great business is built around a secret that’s hidden from the outside

### 9 Foundations

Get things right in the beginning, or you're done.

> “Thiel’s law”: a startup messed up at its foundation cannot be fixed.

Choice of founders / partners.

Equity splits.

Contracts about the future / if things go bad.



### 10 The Mechanics of Mafia

Hire great people that you want to hang out with after work.

> From the start, I wanted PayPal to be tightly knit instead of transactional. I thought stronger relationships would make us not just happier and better at work but also more successful in our careers even beyond PayPal. So we set out to hire people who would actually enjoy working together. They had to be talented, but even more than that they had to be excited about working specifically with us. That was the start of the PayPal Mafia.

Be like a cult, but working on something right. Fanatical.

> People at a successful startup are fanatically right about something those outside it have missed.

### 11 If You Build It, Will They Come?

Sales. Distribution.

> We underestimate the importance of distribution—a catchall term for everything it takes to sell a product—because we share the same bias

Sales is hard. You must make it happen.

Killer sales can even make a monopoly.

> Superior sales and distribution by itself can create a monopoly, even with no product differentiation.

There is a gap between personal sales (high-touch) and no sales (ads).

> In between personal sales (salespeople obviously required) and traditional advertising (no salespeople required) there is a dead zone.

If you can't reach customers by high-touch (because the produce is not expensive enough) or ads (because they don't congregate where you can advertise), you're in trouble.

Also sell your company to employees and investors. E.g. "the secret". Eventually sell to the media, e.g. PR.

We're all salespeople.

> Everybody has a product to sell—no matter whether you’re an employee, a founder, or an investor. It’s true even if your company consists of just you and your computer. Look around. If you don’t see any salespeople, you’re the salesperson.


### 12 Man and Machine

Tech does not replace people, it amplifies people.

Better to amplify with tech then to replace with different/cheaper people (globalization).

> The stark differences between man and machine mean that gains from working with computers are much higher than gains from trade with other people.

The pairing can also be the core of the business.

> Complementarity between computers and humans isn’t just a macro-scale fact. It’s also the path to building a great business.

We miss it. We're trained to miss it.

> Software engineers tend to work on projects that replace human efforts because that’s what they’re trained to do.

> Just look at the trendiest fields in computer science today. The very term “machine learning” evokes imagery of replacement, and its boosters seem to believe that computers can be taught to perform almost any task, so long as we feed them enough training data.

Together, we'll do new things.

> As we find new ways to use computers, they won’t just get better at the kinds of things people already do; they’ll help us to do what was previously unimaginable.

### 13 Seeing Green

### 14 The Founder’s Paradox

Founders are odd people.

They are not average, they are contradictions.

> Normally we expect opposite traits to be mutually exclusive: a normal person can’t be both rich and poor at the same time, for instance. But it happens all the time to founders: startup CEOs can be cash poor but millionaires on paper.

These traits are exaggerated in a cycle.

They are strange, but we need them.

If you are a founder, accept the trade-off.

> The lesson for founders is that individual prominence and adulation can never be enjoyed except on the condition that it may be exchanged for individual notoriety and demonization at any moment—so be careful.


### Conclusion: Stagnation or Singularity?

Expect a take-off.

> That leaves the fourth scenario, in which we create new technology to make a much better future.

But we have to build it.

> Our task today is to find singular ways to create the new things that will make the future not just different, but better—to go from 0 to 1. The essential first step is to think for yourself. Only by seeing our world anew, as fresh and strange as it was to the ancients who saw it first, can we both re-create it and preserve it for the future.

## Quotes

> The best entrepreneurs know this: every great business is built around a secret that's hidden from the outside. A great company is a conspiracy to change the world; when you share your secret, the recipient becomes a fellow conspirator.

> Every moment in business happens only once. The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won't make a search engine. And the next Mark Zuckerberg won't create a social network. If you are copying these guys, you aren't learning from them

> What important truth do very few people agree with you on?

> Elite students climb confidently until they reach a level of competition sufficiently intense to beat their dreams out of them. Higher education is the place where people who had big plans in high school get stuck in fierce rivalries with equally smart peers over conventional careers like management consulting and investment banking. For the privilege of being turned into conformists, students (or their families) pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in skyrocketing tuition that continues to outpace inflation. Why are we doing this to ourselves?

> The most valuable businesses of coming decades will be built by entrepreneurs who seek to empower people rather than try to make them obsolete.

> Monopoly is the condition of every successful business.

> If your goal is to never make a mistake in your life, you shouldn't look for secrets. The prospect of being lonely but right—dedicating your life to something that no one else believes in—is already hard. The prospect of being lonely and wrong can be unbearable.

> You should focus relentlessly on something you're good at doing, but before that you must think hard about whether it will be valuable in the future.

> Customers won't care about any particular technology unless it solves a particular problem in a superior way. And if you can't monopolize a unique solution for a small market, you'll be stuck with vicious competition.

> The single most powerful pattern I have noticed is that successful people find value in unexpected places, and they do this by thinking about business from first principles instead of formulas.

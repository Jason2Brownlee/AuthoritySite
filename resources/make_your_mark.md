## Takeaways

### Define your purpose

> Ask: How can your personal purpose align with your organization's purpose to create the conditions to do good in the world?
> Ask: Can you live your purpose in a more all-encompassing way?
> Ask: What does your purpose reveal about what you should stop doing?
> Ask: What does your purpose imply you must be patient about?

> We have this line at O'Reilly: "Create more value than you capture." (TIM O'REILLY)

> "IF WE DISAPPEARED, WHO WOULD MISS US? AND WHY?" This question was shared with me by Doug Rauch, former president of Trader Joe's. (WARREN BERGER)

> “BE A GIVER, NOT A TAKER” Every time you make a decision, look at how your business can “create more value than it captures,” as they say at O'Reilly Media.

### Build your product

> For your customer, the product is ultimately his or her experience of it and nothing more.

No one will read the manual:

> People will quickly become acquainted with your product and discover the surface features without your assistance. The vast majority of your users will continue to use the product with just those initial features that they discovered at the outset.

(JANE NI DHULCHAOINTIGH)
> 1. Put your product in the user's hands before it's perfect. See what happens.
> 2. “Show your users what they can do, rather than telling them what they should do.
> 3. Empower your users to be your ambassadors, their word is more powerful than yours.


> THINK SMALL. Focus on making one great product that a small group of people truly want. Nail that first; then (and only then) think about expanding your offerings.


### Serving your customers

> Paul Graham gave them some counterintuitive advice: He encouraged them to “do things that don't scale. (advice to airbnb founders)

> Every time someone lands on your website or purchases your product, they’re raising their hand and letting you know that they care. We’d be wise to return the favor. Listen to your customers, no matter how much it slows you down.

> The first thing is the need to be empathetic and the importance of being friendly, super-friendly.

> PLAY THE LONG GAME. Get to know your customers—and their pain points—early on, even if it requires tactics that aren’t sustainable. You have to perfect the customer experience before you can scale.

> DELIGHT IS IN THE DETAILS. Don’t forget to have fun, and imbue your brand experience with "small kindnesses." Customers notice the little things; no detail is too small to be an opportunity for delight.


### Leading your team

> What I’ve learned through this process is that leadership isn’t about power or control or hierarchy; it’s about serving.

## Chapter Summaries / Quotes

### Introduction

> The smarter, faster, cheaper approach includes creating (or getting involved with in other ways) valuable content (text, video, audio, and/or speeches/workshops)—both on- line and off—that is focused on educating, inspiring, and/or entertaining. It also means that you have to consciously focus on one-on-one relationship building (online and off) with a mentality of giving, and in many cases you can use your content as a handshake.

### Chapter 1: The Shift - Finding Those Eyeballs and Big Mouths

> There has NEVER been a better opportunity to build, market, and promote a successful business. The tools are avail- able to just about everyone. There’s never been a better time to market like an entrepreneur and be the David and outhustle Goliath—no matter what your business is.

> The goal is to appeal to a specific, passionate, subset of people.

> We are media sources, not product pushers

> New media sources (bloggers, video bloggers, online content providers) in your niche can have a more substantial effect than the traditional kinds. Not only do they have passionate audiences, but they’re able to reach people all over the planet ... and can attract traditional media coverage.

> Content is king. Marketing is the queen. Our website is our throne.

### Chapter 2: Create Your Foundation - Be a Human, Not a Company

> The perfect storm for marketing smarter, faster, cheaper includes three qualities:
> 1. Passion
> 2. Personality
> 3. Knowledge


### Chapter 3: Become a Trusted Resource - Because Nobody Cares About Your Product

Show your face, be the face.

> Now, despite what we’ve covered so far—just making yourself visible and acting as the face of your business—doesn’t mean that everything—or really, anything—is about you. It’s about your customers. Your clients. Your potential clients.

### Chapter 4: Selling Sucks - To Educate, Inspire, and Entertain Is Fun

Use education-based marketing.

> If you give educational, inspirational, and/or entertaining content away—with your number one goal being to help people—your business will flourish.

### Chapter 5: Be Your Own Media Source

Take control, don't ask for permission.

Experiment.

> There isn’t a road map for compelling content becoming a media source.

> Posting to your website is free. Most social media sites are free to use.

Content compounds.

> Online content stays up—in most cases, forever, or until you choose to take it down. This means that even six months from now, someone can link to a post you put up today, last week, or last month. It also means that value can increase over time—just as it often does in a long-term relationship.

Be the expert.


> Having expertise in an area is critical, and creating content positions you as the trusted resource in your industry when done correctly.

### Chapter 6: The Art and Science of Experimenting and Creating Content

Niche down.

> Finding that niche is so important online. What is yours?

> What is something that should always be around for the most part?

> Artists create.

> Consistency is huge.

> Whatever your unique ability/characteristic/talent is, use it to your advantage.

### Chapter 8: Market and Promote Your Business by Helping Others

### Chapter 9: The Keys to Marketing, Promoting, and Building Your Community

Do SEO.

Lots of other methods.

### Chapter 10: Creating a Sharable and Spreadable Website

Build a great site.

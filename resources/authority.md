## Quotes

> You can continue to create cutting-edge work and strive to be the best in your industry, but until you start teaching and sharing, your reach and influence will be limited.

> The main idea I want to leave you with from this book is this: if you know a skill that other people use to make money, you can make a living by teaching that skill.

> A decent length for an eBook is 25,000 words. If you were to maintain writing 1,000 words a day (which is really just 2 or 3 pages) for 30 days you would have 30,000 words. Do some editing and cut down your content (which is necessary), and you have a book written in 30 days. That's quite an accomplishment.

> So a higher price—based on value delivered—plus multiple packages can at times increase your revenue by four times. That's how you avoid being a poor, starving author.

> A good product solves a painful problem. You need to talk to your customers to find exactly what those pains are so that you can write to them.

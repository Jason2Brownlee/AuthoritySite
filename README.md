# Authority Site Advice

[Resources](#resources) and [advice](#advice) on how to build, operate, and sell an authority website (niche site) by yourself (solopreneur).

<!-- section -->
## About

An authority website is a highly trusted and reputable online platform recognized for its extensive, well-researched content and expertise in a specific niche or industry.

I've had [some success](advice/success.md) with authority websites over the years. I'm often asked about how to get started.

This project captures my best advice on the topic: to consume quality blogs/podcasts/books on the topic and do what they say. This is how I got started.

<!-- section -->
## Thesis

[My thesis](advice/thesis.md) is that developers are under huge time pressures to get results. They would prefer to search for solutions online and copy-paste code rather than read and understand API docs. I refer to this as: "_no one will RTFM_". Most APIs are open source and most API docs are terse and user-hostile and developers prefer worked examples over function definitions. Tools like ChatGPT and GPT4 have an [impact on this thesis](advice/thesis_chatgpt.md).

A specific undeserved technical topic is selected as the focus for the authority site, that then offers a vast number of tutorials and answer all the common questions about the topic. Developers that need help with the topic find it via Google searches and keep coming back as the content is free and helpful, which builds trust. In exchange for an email address the site offers more value in the form of free cheat sheets, guides, and email courses to readers. Once on the list, the site then offers paid self-study information products for those readers looking to learn the topic systematically and to a greater depth.

It requires a love of daily writing, daily helping/serving developers, and figuring out messy technical topics. This model is repeatable, a skill that can be taught/learned, and can be iteratively improved upon. Therefore continuous study of the model itself (this project) is an important part of the model.

The resources I recommend and my advice all support this thesis.

<!-- section -->
## Resources

My first piece of advice is that I recommend reading high-quality books and listening to high-quality podcasts.

This is how I learned.

Remember, you get good at this stuff by doing not consuming.

2. What do you with the money? How do you invest and live off investment income?

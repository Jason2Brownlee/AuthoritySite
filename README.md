# Authority Site Resources

Resources on how to develop, operate, and sell an authority website.

## About

An authority website is a highly trusted and reputable online platform recognized for its extensive, well-researched content and expertise in a specific niche or industry.

I've had some success developing, running, and selling authority websites and over the years I'm often asked questions about them.

This project captures my advice, basically to read high quality books on the topic and do what they say.

I have written a book of my own on the subject (for my sons) telling the story of how I built, ran, and sold a 7-figure site and I may release it publicly one day, but not yet. Until then, this project contains my best advice in the form of a reading list.

I used to direct people to my [goodreads shelf](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/5243638-jason?shelf=authority-site), but it was too hard for them to navigate.

## Thesis

I focused on technical writing for developers.

My thesis was that developers are lazy and would prefer to search for and copy-paste answers online than understand an API or read a book.

Therefore I created websites to answer common question in a given niche with the goal of becoming a trusted resources on the topic. I offered free guides and email courses and offered information products for those readers looking to take the next step.

I also love writing, I love helping/serving, and I love figuring out messy technical topics. The business and model fits me very well. If it does not fit you well, adapt it.

The resources I suggest have this thesis in mind. I re-read many of these books each year as a reminder.

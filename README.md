# Authority Site Advice

Advice on how to develop, operate, and sell an authority website .

## About

An authority website is a highly trusted and reputable online platform recognized for its extensive, well-researched content and expertise in a specific niche or industry.

I've had some success developing, running, and selling authority websites (e.g. [CleverAlgorithms](https://web.archive.org/web/20130120074424/CleverAlgorithms.com) (archived), [MobileGameEngines](https://web.archive.org/web/20131108154500/http://mobilegameengines.com/) (archived), [MachineLearningMastery](https://MachineLearningMastery.com) (sold), and [SuperFastPython](https://SuperFastPython.com)). Over the years I'm often asked questions about how to get started.

This project captures my advice, basically to read high quality books on the topic and do what they say.

I have written a book of my own on the subject (for my sons) telling the story of how I built, ran, and sold a 7-figure site (titled "_The Story of Machine Learning Mastery: How I Built, Operated, and Sold a Multimillion-Dollar Website_"). I may release it publicly one day, but not yet. Until then, this project contains my best advice in the form of a reading list.

I used to direct people to my goodreads [authority shelf](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/5243638-jason?shelf=authority-site) and [writing shelf](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/5243638-jason?shelf=writing), but it is too hard to navigate.

**Remember**: Reading books without changing behavior or taking action is procrastination. Start then read.

## Thesis

I focused on technical writing for developers.

My thesis is that developers are lazy and would prefer to search for and copy-paste answers online rather than understand an API or read a technical book (I know, I'm one of them). I refer to this as: "_no one will RTFM_".

Therefore I created websites to answer all the common questions in a given niche with the goal of becoming a trusted resources. I offer free tutorials, free guides and free email courses, then offer paid information products for those readers looking to take the next step.

I also love daily writing, I love helping/serving developers, and I love figuring out messy technical topics. Therefore, the business model and work required fit me well. Consider whether they fit you.

The resources I recommend below support this thesis.

After exiting, you have to deal with two things:

1. Now what? What is the meaning of life?
2. What do you with the money? How do you invest and live off investments?

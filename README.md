# Authority Site Advice

Advice on how to build, operate, and sell an authority website (niche site) by yourself (solopreneur).

## About

An authority website is a highly trusted and reputable online platform recognized for its extensive, well-researched content and expertise in a specific niche or industry.

I've had [some success](notes/success.md) with authority websites over the years. I'm often asked about how to get started.

This project captures my best advice: to consume quality blogs/podcasts/books on the topic and do what they say. This is how I got started.

I used to send emails with lists of podcasts and books, then later directed people to my goodreads [authority shelf](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/5243638-jason?shelf=authority-site) and [writing shelf](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/5243638-jason?shelf=writing).

## Thesis

[My thesis](notes/thesis.md) is that developers are under huge time pressures to get results. They would prefer to search for solutions online and copy-paste code rather than read and understand API docs. I refer to this as: "_no one will RTFM_". Most APIs are open source and most API docs are terse and user-hostile and developers prefer worked examples over function definitions.

A specific undeserved technical topic is selected as the focus for the authority site, that then offers a vast number of tutorials and answer all the common questions about the topic. Developers that need help with the topic find it via Google searches and keep coming back as the content is free and helpful, which builds trust. In exchange for an email address I offer more value in the form of free cheat sheets, guides, and email courses to readers. I then offer paid self-study information products for those readers looking to learn the topic systematically and to a greater depth.

It requires a love of daily writing, daily helping/serving developers, and figuring out messy technical topics. This model is repeatable, a skill that can be taught/learned, and can be iteratively improved upon. Therefore continuous study of the model itself (this project) is an important part of the model.

Below are the best resources to support this thesis.

## After Exiting

After exiting, you have to deal with two things:

1. Now what? What is the meaning of life?
2. What do you with the money? How do you invest and live off investment income?

See my goodreads [retirement shelf](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/5243638-jason?shelf=retirement) and [personal finance shelf](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/5243638-jason?shelf=personal-finance) for how I explored these issues.

## Final Remarks

### On Advice

I've had tens of coffees where people "pick my brain" about building an authority site business.

I've sent hundreds of emails with book recommendations to people asking how to get started.

As far as I know, zero people I have advised started anything.

I don't think people take advice. Honestly, I think the above resources are only useful to those who have already started building an authority site business or are already running one. I don't know how to motivate someone who is interested, to actually start.

But I might be wrong. If only one person is inspired to dive in, then this guide was worth it.

Probably the real goal of this project is so that I can talk to myself. There is so much stuff to keep in your head to do "authority sites" well that I need to constantly remind myself of things. Re-reading books and adding notes to this project does that for me.

### Disclosures

I have added links to all books on Amazon. If you purchase a book from Amazon using my links, thank you kindly. As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.

I have added notes on some books and essays. ChatGPT was used to provide lists of the main points.

### Email me

Did this guide help? Please let me know.

I love books. Do you have any recommendations? Please share some titles.

If you want to chat about authority sites, please email me.

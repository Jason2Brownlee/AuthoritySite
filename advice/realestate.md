# Developing Real Estate

We are developing real estate.

The market is undeserved and you want to serve it.

I like to think of it as a stinky marsh. There are dry patches, but it mostly sucks. We're going to fill in the land, make it dry and flat and start building streets, shops, housing, etc. We are developing the land and making it productive and attractive.

People can start moving in and doing things. Also the land is now attractive to buyers.

Maybe the analogy is bunk.

Nevertheless.

Every tutorial we publish expands the real estate and makes the entire thing more valuable.

With effort, we can conjure real estate from nothing.

Websites are online or virtual real estate.


## Elaboration

Here's what our friend chatgpt has to say about the idea:

Adding webpages to your website is akin to the process of developing real estate from raw land. This analogy draws parallels between these two concepts, highlighting the transformative and value-adding aspects of creating web content. Here's an elaboration on this comparison:

1. **Raw Land vs. Domain Name**:
   - Raw Land: Just as real estate development begins with a plot of raw land, your website starts with a domain name. This domain is the foundation on which you'll build your online presence.

2. **Construction Plans vs. Content Creation**:
   - Raw Land: Developers draft architectural plans to design the layout, appearance, and purpose of a building. These plans guide construction.
   - Website: Each webpage represents a digital "building" with a specific purpose. Content creation is equivalent to constructing the infrastructure of your online real estate.

3. **Building Structures vs. Webpages**:
   - Raw Land: The construction process involves erecting physical structures like houses, offices, or retail spaces.
   - Website: Each webpage serves as a virtual structure that provides information, services, or products. These structures serve the needs and interests of your online visitors.

4. **Utility Connections vs. Hyperlinks**:
   - Raw Land: Developers connect buildings to utilities like electricity, water, and sewage systems for functionality.
   - Website: Hyperlinks are the "utilities" that connect webpages. They ensure seamless navigation and access to different parts of your online real estate.

5. **Property Value vs. Web Traffic**:
   - Raw Land: As real estate developments progress, property values increase due to factors like location, amenities, and demand.
   - Website: The value of your online real estate grows as web traffic, user engagement, and content quality increase. Valuable web content attracts more visitors.

6. **Zoning and Purpose vs. Webpage Focus**:
   - Raw Land: Zoning regulations dictate the purpose of real estate, such as residential, commercial, or industrial.
   - Website: Each webpage is designed with a specific focus, catering to the needs of your target audience. They may serve informational, transactional, or educational purposes, just like different zones in real estate.

7. **Maintenance and Renovation vs. Content Updates**:
   - Raw Land: Real estate requires ongoing maintenance, renovations, and updates to retain its value and functionality.
   - Website: Regularly updating and refreshing web content is equivalent to maintenance. It ensures that your online real estate remains relevant and appealing.

8. **Profit Generation vs. Monetization**:
   - Raw Land: Developed real estate generates rental income, sales revenue, or other profits.
   - Website: Your online real estate can generate income through various monetization methods, such as advertising, e-commerce, subscription models, or affiliate marketing.

9. **Expansion and Growth vs. Scalability**:
   - Raw Land: Real estate developers may expand and develop adjacent properties to maximize returns.
   - Website: Websites can scale by adding more webpages and features to accommodate growing audiences and evolving market needs.

In this analogy, webpages are the digital equivalent of real estate structures, and the process of website development mirrors real estate development. Both involve creating valuable assets from initially vacant or unoptimized spaces, resulting in a potentially profitable venture.

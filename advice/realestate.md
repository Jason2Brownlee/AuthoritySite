# Developing Real Estate

We are developing real estate.

The market is undeserved and you want to serve it.

I like to think of it as a stinky marsh. There are dry patches, but it mostly sucks. We're going to fill in the land, make it dry and flat and start building streets, shops, housing, etc. We are developing the land and making it productive and attractive.

People can start moving in and doing things. Also the land is now attractive to buyers.

Maybe the analogy is bunk.

Nevertheless.

Every tutorial we publish expands the real estate and makes the entire thing more valuable.

With effort, we can conjure real estate from nothing.

Websites are online or virtual real estate.

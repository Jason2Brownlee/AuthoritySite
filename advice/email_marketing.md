# How to do email marketing?

Use a service that supports auto-responders and broadcast emails.

There are three main types of emails to send.

* Main Sequence
* Newsletter
* Mini-Courses


## Main Sequence

Have a main list that nurtures leads and lets the get to know the business.

Offer a lead magnet to get on the list.

Provide an opt-in on the homepage.

Provide a sign-up on every page, perhaps using a popup.

Be warned that developers generally dislike popups. Nevertheless, they work.


## Newsletter

Send a newsletter every week summarizing what is happening in the business, e.g. new posts, new and upcoming books, surveys, etc.

Send to all prospects on the list.

Perhaps don't send to people on the main sequence and people on a mini-course. It might be overwhelming.


## Mini-Courses

Have mini-courses of 7 or 14 days for each category in the business that teaches the topic as a crash course and sells the business.

These are offered as a lead magnet on blog post tutorials.

Their goal is to nurture the prospect until they are ready to buy the related product.



## Other

Use a service that supports conditional sending or workflows to ensure you are sending the right offers at the right times.

For example:

* Send an email sequence after each purchase to collect reviews.
* Send cross-sell and up sell sequences after a purchase is made.
* Send highly engaged sequences for prospects visit lots of pages on a topic but are not on the mini course.
* Send abandonment sequences for prospects that visit a sales page but do not buy.
* Send re-engagement sequences for prospects that have not opened an email in a long time.

You might be able to bounce people from mini-course to mini-course on related topics until they find something they want to buy.

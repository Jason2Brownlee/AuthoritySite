# Control the Sale

Should we sell products off-site?

For example, just link to the product on amazon or some other hosted platform.

The answer is: probably not.

The idea is to control the sales funnel.

Selling off site means:

* You cannot control public facing reviews.
* You cannot follow-up with customers.
* You cannot offer order bumps, up-sells, down-sells, cross-sells, etc.

Alternate sales platforms could be used as content marketing.

For example, selling low price kindle books on amazon as lead magnets.

Other marketers do sell on amazon and I expect they are used as a content marketing platform for back-end offers.

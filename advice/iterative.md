# Selecting the topic and subtopics is iterative.

The first pass will be wrong.

It will not be clear where the real problems are, what the valuable products will be and so on.

You must spend time in the niche, talking to the people and studying all of the material in order to really get this.

It might even have to be pointed out to you, especially if you think you "know" the niche beforehand.

It might take years. Probably 3 years of writing tutorials, releasing books, and talking to developers.

I'm not kidding. At least 1,000 days.

Expect to iterate.

Iterate everything.

* Iterate the tagline of the business.
* Iterate the structure of the site.
* Iterate the hooks for lead magnets and products.
* Iterate subtopics for products.
* Iterate bundles.
* Iterate content mediums / channels.
* And so on.

It is so easy to get stuck on something that works initially and to stop experimenting.

This is a massive error.

If the experiments are all pre-defined, then you can revisit the ideas and pick up where you left off.

Iterate on everything at every level all the time.

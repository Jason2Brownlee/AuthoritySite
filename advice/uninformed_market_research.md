# Uninformed Market Research

We have perhaps some candidate topic ideas, but we know very little about how viable they are as a business idea.

Therefore, we need to learn a lot about the market for the topic, quickly.

First, you also need to capture everything you think and know about the topic before you get polluted by diving deep into the topic.

I call this "naive" or "uninformed" market research, because we are not doing research. It comes out of your head and contains all the limitations and biases you carry around.

Let's get real. It's probably all going to be discard, but the work will prime our pattern recognition abilities we will rely on later.

Create a new google document and add a new heading for each part of this research.

Again, keep this document, even if you choose or discard the idea. If you discard the idea, the document can be used as a template. If you choose the idea, the content can be used as the basis of content and marketing.

This part of market research has the following:

* Topic Synonyms
* Topic Relations
* Topic People
* Topic Features and Benefits
* Topic Money
* Topic Difficulty
* Topic Curiosity
* Why You?


## Topic Synonyms

Select a topic name and list all possible synonyms for the topic.

You may have a list of synonyms from the brainstorming session.

Start with this list, and add more if you can think of them. Add to this as you come across them.

Some ideas that may help your brainstorming:

* How would you search for the topic on google?
* How would you search for an API or open source project on the topic?
* How would you search on amazon for a book on the topic?
* What would the topic be called if taught in a university course?

Select one name to be the topic name going forward. It should be the most common or most obvious name.

If you're not sure, pick one that is good enough, you can always circle back later and change it.



## Topic Relations

Consider where the topic fits in terms of parent, sibling and child topics.

This task is really about getting crystal clear about the scope of the topic, and what is in and out of scope. What is too broad and what is in an adjacent topic.

Start by listing the parent topics and their relationship to the current topic. Parent topics are broader and are probably contained in the name already.

For example, if the topic is "python logging", then one parent topic is "python" and another is "logging". Start to build up a hierarchy of parent topics to your chosen topic.

```default
-> Programming
	-> Python Programming
		-> Advanced Python Programming
			-> Python Logging
```

Or perhaps you can explore a language agnostic approach:

```default
-> Software Development
	-> Programming
		-> Maintenance
			-> Logging
```

Now brainstorm sibling topics that fit along side your chosen topic.

A thought experiment might be: if your topic was a chapter in a book, what would the other chapters be about. Alternately, if a training course or on-site workshop had a module on your topic, what other modules would there be?

This will help you understand and choose the right level of detail for your topic.

For example, if the topic is "python logging", then sibling topics might be "python unit testing", "python profiling", and "python debugging". They all feel like advanced topics, separate from basic python programming.


```default
-> Advanced Python Programming
	-> Python Logging
	-> Python Unit Testing
	-> Python Profiling
	-> Python Debugging
	-> ...
```

The sibling topics are adjacent to your topic and out of scope for now.

Later, they could become relevant as "shoulder niches" relevant to your main topic niche.

For example:

- Debugging + Python logging
- Unit Testing + Python logging
- Profiling + Python logging

Finally, it's time to brainstorm child topics or subtopics for your chosen topic.

A useful thought exercise is if you read a book on your topic, what would the chapters be? Or if you took a course on the topic, what would the modules include? Perhaps you can think of many different books or courses that could be written or made on your topic, in which case they would be considered subtopics of your topic.

It might be helpful to consider this from two angles. The first from your programming language perspective and the second from the language-agnostic perspective as it might appear in a textbook or a university course.

For example, if the topic is "python logging", then subtopics might include "logging to file", "logging to a database", "logging levels", and so on.

```default
Programming
	-> Python Programming
		-> Python Logging
			-> Logging to File
			-> Logging to Database
			-> Logging Levels
			-> ...
```

Exhaust your knowledge of the topic by listing every subtopic you can think of at the appropriate level of detail. This might include sub-topics, if that helps.

You may notice that your topic is too broad because it has a vast number of subtopics. In that case, you need to select a sub-topic as the topic.

You may notice that your topic is too narrow because you cannot think of any or many sub-topics. This may or may not be thew case depending on your knowledge of the domain. Perhaps hold off on changing topics until after you do some more informed market research.

You now have some idea of the scope of your topic, what is in and out of scope.

Sharpen this up later as you learn more during informed market research.


## Topic People

Consider who would be interested on the topic and why.

First, consider the types of people who might be interested in the topic.

* Who would buy a book or take a course on the topic?
* Who would buy material on the topic for someone else and who would they be?
* Who would take a subject on the topic at university?
* Who would develop code that used the topic?
* Who would use the API?
* Who would use an open source project on the topic?

For example, if a developer, then what type of developer (e.g. web, mobile, etc)? What skill level (beginner, intermediate etc.) What type of project (self-improvement, new project, existing code base)? What features are they trying to add? What bugs are they trying to debug?

If a manager, what type of manager (product, project, etc.)? What type of project (web, application, etc.) What kind of deadlines, how expensive, so on.

If a student, what is their major and minor subjects? What university?

It won't be clear which group is the most in need of your help. If you were put in front of a room of these developers, you don't even know what questions to ask to divide them into groups. This brain storming is to help you come up with these kinds of questions.

Another consideration might be, what does a super fan look like.

* What if a developer was obsessed with the topic, what would they be doing?
* What would they be reading? What side-projects would they be developing?
* What conferences would they be attending or online communities would they be visiting?

There will be developers obsessed with the topic, and they will be helpful allies.


## Topic Features and Benefits

Consider the features and benefits of the topic to the people that may be interested in it.

What can the topic do? These are the features of the topic.

Nobody wants logging, they want the things that logging can do for them.

For example, a developer does not want a log object, they want a system that records major events of a software system.

Why do people care? These are the benefits of the feature.

Nobody wants logging features, they want the capabilities that the features provide to the user, even if the developer is the user.

For example, a developer does not want a log file of events, they want an easy way to identify cases of major events in a software system, like details of errors when something goes wrong. Ultimately, they want to implement the functional or non-functional requirements of software.

It might be easiest to captures the features and benefits in a table, with a feature on the left and the benefit or benefits on the right.

If you had to sell the topic itself, what would a developer be buying exactly? What problems does it solve and why do they care?

This might be hard, but is very important.

Again, you may need to revisit this section later once you learn more about the topic.



## Topic Money

Consider how a prospects and customers may use the topic to make money.

It may be how they directly make money, but more likely it will be indirect. Such as getting a skill that lets them get a promotion or to change to a better job that pays more.

For example:

* Perhaps a developer can earn a larger salary or get a better job with a better salary if they know the topic. Is this true, how and where would you check later on?
* Perhaps developers can use the topic to make money directly. What are some ideas?
* Perhaps managers look better and get promoted if their product has the features provided by your topic. What are those features?
* Perhaps software companies need the features of your topic to make their software work. What are those features?
* Perhaps students are more employable if they have the topic on their resume or job application.




## Topic Difficulty

Consider why the topic is challenging or difficult for developers.

What negative things does a developer think to themselves when the topic is brought up? This might be a developer that is less confident that yourself.

* What does everyone "know", that is not (technically) true?

Another way to think about this is, if the topic is important for a developer to learn at some point, what negative self-talk stops them from learning the topic.

* Perhaps the topic is hard to learn. If so, why is this the case?
* Perhaps the topic only looks hard to learn. If so, why?
* Perhaps the topic has a bad reputation, what is it?

For example, if the topic is logging, perhaps some difficulties could be:

* Logging is slow.
* Log data is useless to end users.
* Log files are unreadable.

The idea is to flush out any general emotions that developers feel about the topic, even if they are misconceptions.

These will all have to be addressed at some point.

You will learn a lot more about what real developers think about your topic later on. Eventually, you will converge on a handful of difficulties that will provide the basis of objections for you to address in your marketing copy.



## Topic Curiosity

Consider why the topic is exciting, interesting or sparks curiosity in developers.

There will be aspects of the topic that provoke developers in a positive way.

These aspects may or may not be related to features and benefits. They could be less tangible, but central to why developers dive into a topic.

* Perhaps developers describe the topic in a specific way to other developers. How do they?
* Perhaps there is some marketing around the topic that is effective. What is it?
* Perhaps there is a technical itch that the topic scratches. What is it?

For example, with python logging, perhaps the systematic nature of recording events is interesting, or the correct usage of log levels for event types, or ways of making logging not impact the performance of the main application.

What is exciting about the topic?



## Why You?

Consider why you're the person for this topic.

There are two aspects to this. The first is "why this topic" and the second is "why you".

Firstly, consider why you want to help developers with this topic. Will you be happy if you have to hang around developers working on this topic for the next five years?

* Listening to their problems and complaints each day?
* Reading their code and offering suggestions
* Reading the API documentation and explaining it to others.

It is a big commitment and you need to become obsessed with the topic.

If this is a hard sell now, don't worry, maybe you will see things next that you can get obsessed with.

Secondly, why you?

Consider why you are the person to help developers with this topic.

* Perhaps you have experience with the topic.
* Perhaps you have used the topic on a project with success.
* Perhaps you have a knack of researching, distilling, synthesizing, explaining technical topics.

What is your persona? You may be the expert explaining how, you might be able to become the expert after some study yourself. Maybe you're the coach who offers training. Maybe your on a journey to master the topic and invite others on the journey with you.

Make a case that you are the person for the job.

Do you have a super power that can help developers with this topic, what is it?

* What is your unique advantage?

Again, this might be a hard now, you may do a better job at this later. Come back then if you must, but just down at least one sentence now.

This will become copy on the about page later on.



## Don't Rush

Take your time and fill out as much as you can for each section.

This is valuable stuff because it captures all of your biases, perhaps shared by other developers.

Some of the information will be correct, but most will be wrong to some degree, such as the wrong level of detail or lacking nuance.

You will come back to these sections in the future and fill them in with real information learned from market research such as surveys and talking with prospects and customers.

# Borrow Ideas

Create a list of 50-100 authority sites that you can check regularly to get ideas.

Including:

* Ideas for content
* Ideas for calls to action
* Ideas for structure
* Ideas for in-content ads
* Ideas for funnels.
* etc

Keep the sites in a spreadsheet.

Treat them like authority site mentors.

Some example websites that I have learned a lot from include:

* https://neilpatel.com/

Get inspired by what you see.

Run experiments.

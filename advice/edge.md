# You must have an edge

What is your unfair advantage?

There are table steaks. What you must have just to turn up.

1. Software engineer that can read and write code.
2. Writer that can devise, write, edit and publish high quality content
3. Research scneitist that can think of what is needed then figure it out.
4. Marketer who can get inside the head of the reader and help them see a new way.

But, on top of that, you need to have an edge.

What makes you "The Guy" for the topic?

* You must be world class at the topic.
* You must be able to show that you are world class at the topic.
* You must be able to help people with technical questions.

You need to have or need to develop an unfair advantage.

Something that you have that others won't that make you outstanding at the thing you do for the people you help.

You need an edge.

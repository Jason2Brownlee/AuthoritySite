# Should I offer discounts?

Yes.

* Offer discounts to anyone that asks.
* Offer discounts for sales, like summer, spring, christmas, black friday, etc.
* Offer discounts to less well-off groups like students and the retired.

Advertise the discounts far and wide, such as on social, email and on the site via a site-wide banner.

Advertise standing discount (e.g. students) on the sales page.

Some people are trained to only purchase with a discount code.

Offer a discount.

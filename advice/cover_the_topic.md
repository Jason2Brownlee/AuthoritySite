# Cover The Topic Well

The book must solve the problems for the reader.

This requires an expert knowledge of the topic.

Not all of this knowledge has to appear in the book, only a distilled form.

Nevertheless, all of this knowledge should appear in the public facing tutorials.

This means we often will have many more tutorials than chapters in the book. Perhaps 2x or 4x as many.

This is great.

* Great for marketing.
* Great for SEO.
* Great for topical authority.
* Great for developing expertise.
* Great for taking a few swings at hard ideas.
* ...

This means we need to answer all the questions.

We need to cover all the things.

Keep a massive spreadsheet and add to it every day.
Structure the spreadsheet by subtopics.
Hunt out more things that could be written about.

* Check all the results in the SERPs.
* Check all the keywords in the google adwords keyword planner.
* Check all the google search suggestions.
* Check all the questions on stackoverflow for the topic.
* Check all of the API.
* ...

Not all, but close to it.

Be through.

Do it once, do it again, do it often.

You will see questions and answers in a different light as expertise is developed.

Become world class at the topic then show this with the tutorials and capture it in the book so others can get there faster.

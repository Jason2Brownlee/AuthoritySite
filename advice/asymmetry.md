# Asymmetric Upside

Building out the site, writing content, developing information products, and helping people.

Doing this work has an asymmetric upside.

We do it because we must. We are obsessed. We need to know.

A side effect is that it can be profitable. Not that it will be, but it could be, and probably will be if chosen carefully.

That way we can do our work, and work hard, and only win. In some cases, we can win big.

Developing an authority site has an asymmetric upside if seen this way.

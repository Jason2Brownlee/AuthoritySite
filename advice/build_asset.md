# Build the Asset

The website is an asset.

Every new tutorial builds equality.

The improvement of each tutorial improves the asset.

The quality of the tutorials defines the value of the asset.

Aim for the highest quality possible.

Anything that falls below the quality, must be removed.

Quality must be improving over time.

Each new tutorial should be better than the last. Learn lessons on marketing, readability, structure, etc.

Write tutorials every day, because it builds equality and improves the asset every day.

Few other businesses have such a direct relationship between work and asset size/value.

Especially if the tutorials contribute directly to products.

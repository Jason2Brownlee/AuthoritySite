# Niche Testing

After the deep dive we now have hundreds of ideas to use as the basis for content, and places to look to get hundreds more ideas.

You probably feel overwhelmed, and for good reason.

* There are too many questions and too many ideas to write about.
* There is too much to study and learn.
* There is too much good content in existing long form blog posts and books.

It's to be expected.

You've immersed yourself and know more about the problems, questions, pains and extent of what is available than almost anyone else.

Now it's time to start thinking about what the "worlds best site on your topic" might look like.

This is the goal of the project.

Next, we must:

* Test ideas, and start engaging.
* Play with structure, see what fits.




## Test Ideas

We have done some market research, but we don't really know anything.

The only way to learn about the niche is to engage.

This means:

* Writing content and seeing what works.
* Helping developers directly and see what works.

We also need to see if we like writing about and helping developers with the topic.

* Perhaps writing about the topic is really hard or boring.
* Perhaps developing code examples is challenging or trivial.
* Perhaps the developers in the niche are all rude, advanced, beginners, dumb, students, etc.
* Perhaps the topic is fundamentally uninteresting with nothing to spark the imagination.

We must test in order to learn. It's the fastest way.

There are a few main areas to test.

1. Write code examples.
2. Write pillar posts.
3. Engage offsite.



## No-Lose Testing

Testing requires hard work. An investment of time and money (or opportunity cost).

Therefore, we want to test in a way way where we cannot lose.

So far, we have performed market research and recorded it in documents. These documents are valuable and could be sold as market research work product to any broader website in the niche.

The same must apply to the testing going forward.

You must have tangible work product that can be repurposed or sold, if things don't pan out. You need more than the bland and intangible: "an idea of how to use methods in the subject area".

We will test by creating real and complete content.

This same philosophy will apply going forward if you stick with the topic. Specifically, each piece of content will add another door way to the business, another piece of a digital product like a book or course, another brick in the wall that the asset represents. Completing and adding a piece of content in only ever a win.



## Write Code Examples

Develop code examples to demonstrate the major concepts, techniques, algorithms, data structures, classes, and questions.

This might be 10, 50, or even 100 code files, and might take a week.

Keep adding code examples until you stop learning new things or having good ideas.

Create examples for each high-level topic or category identified previously.

Writing code examples forces you to confront how to actually implement common tasks related to the topic. It also forces you to become familiar with the actual work product that developers require.

* Keep code examples as small as possible.
* Comment well, every file and perhaps even line.
* No compound statements if possible.
* Each example must focus on exactly one task, stub or fake everything off-topic.
* Create a directory to store all the code files with one subdirectory for each major category.

Perhaps don't worry about consistency or comments initially. Just try out all of the features and build familiarity. You can then refactor examples later to be consistent and well commented.

Write down all questions, emotions, ideas, and thoughts along the way in a text file or spreadsheet. Other beginners will likely feel the same things and you must address each with copy and tutorials in the future.

Record all resources you use too and which are actually helpful.

The code examples will not be wasted.

* They may be used as the basis for tutorials.
* They may be used as the basis of a public github repository for the company as demonstration code.
* They may capture assumptions made by beginners, correct or otherwise, which can be invaluable later.

Once you are done, reflect.

Do you like writing code on the topic?

* What ideas do you have for more examples?
* What is fun and engaging and what is boring or a chore?
* How can do you do more of the fun stuff and less of the stuff that's a chore?
* What are the ways that you can make the painful stuff fun?
* How does your code compare to API examples, other posts, and/or examples in books?
* Would you be happy writing code examples like these for 1 year or 3 years or more?

Can you go further.

If you had to set this task to a developer, what programs would you ask them to implement to be sure they have familiarity with the topic. List them. This could be come a self-study exercise.



## Write Pillar Posts

Write the long-form pieces that will form the pillars for the entire website.

Write one pillar post per major high-level topic or category in the site, e.g. 3-to-5 posts.

These will be the target pages that will get the most traffic if you go forward.

* They will be number one for the keyword in google.
* They will be the best free resources on the internet on their subtopic.
* They will be long and complete enough to be short books.
* They will be continually updated, refined, and expanded.
* They will be the way that readers will get to know, like, and trust you.

All other tutorials related to each high-level topic will point to and support the pillar post.

Each post may require 2-to-3 days to a week to research and write.

You must come into developing these tutorials with the mindset of creating the largest, most complete and best one-page resource in the world on each high-level topic.

This means:

* A clear idea of the target keywords and related keywords for which you will rank.
* A systematic breakdown of all pages that currently rank for the target keywords
* A carefully designed page structure that supports the content, and content expansions in the future.
* Carefully designed code examples that solve all major pain problems and deliver quick wins for readers.
* Carefully chosen list of additional resources to read.
* Carefully chosen quotes from authorities and experts.
* Carefully designed graphics that demonstrate key ideas.

You may need to consider a few different approaches to presenting the material until you find one that clicks.

You may need to re-work the pillars in the future as you learn more about the topic and engage, or as you find your voice and tone for the website.

Go further than anyone else.

* 10x more content, perhaps 20k or 30k words where everyone else has 2k words.
* Proofread and copy edited by paid professionals.
* Reviewed and tested by technical editors.

What else can you do?

* Can you can endorsements from subject matter experts?
* Can you turn the post into a kindle ebook, leanpub book, pdf download, and offer it as well?
* Can you provide a download for all of the code?
* Can you pay an artist to professionally re-create the graphics for you?
* Can you create a podcast series from the content and offer it as well?
* Can you create a youtube video or video series from the content and offer it as well?
* Can you have less fluff and more actionable takeaways and quick wins?
* Can you have all of the major use cases ready to copy-and-paste?

You must make it obvious that the content is awesome, that you are a world expert on the topic, and that your site is the place to go to learn more about the topic.

Someone with a pain or frustration on the subtopic must see your pillar and feel excitement and relief.

You do not need to go deep into every section of a piece. Consider that you may be able to link out to content that goes deeper later, once you write it. You may want to have everything there now and pull it out later.

Don't make these pieces live yet. Store them. We will make it live later if we decide to proceed.



## Engage Developers Offsite

You must start helping developers with problems on your topic, offsite.

There are many ways to do this, and you should try them all if possible. Find the few that are easy or make sense and write 5-10 answers per day on each category.

Some examples where you could engage off site include:

* Answer new questions posted to stackoverflow.
* Consider writing answers for old/answered questions on stackoverflow.
* Answer questions posted to reddit.
* Answer questions posted to quora.
* Answer questions on twitter.
* Write comments on new blog posts on the topic.
* Engage in discussions in comment threads on reddit, hacker news, twitter.

No need to link to your own content or defined your expertise. In fact, don't. You don't have a platform yet.

Can you go further, e.g.:

* Take short contract work on UpWork.
* Offer free or cheap consulting over zoom.
* Contribute to an open source project on the topic.

Just help these people.

You will learn so much.

* How to get straight to the point.
* How to actually provide value, instead of definitions and fluff.
* How to listen to real confusion and pain.
* How to takes what you know about the code and adapt it for specific real world queries.

Record everything.

Keep a spreadsheet with links to all posted conent and any additional information such as your restatement of the question, emotions, topic or subtopic.

Record ideas for content such as additional questions and comments that could become new tutorials or parts of tutorials.

Do this for a few weeks, perhaps at the same time as writing the pillar pieces.

Then stop and reflect.

* Who are these developers?
	* What do they know?
	* What do they think?
	* Where are they located?
	* What have they tried?
	* Are they proactive or lazy and why do you think that is?
* Do you like helping these developers?
* How can you help them better one-on-one?
* How could you help them better at scale?
* Do you want to keep helping them for a year, for many years?



## Bonus Ideas

There are additional steps we can do to lower the risks around the idea.

Select a subset of the experts on your topic that you had identified earlier.

Interview each and ask they good questions about the topic. Not technical questions, but emotional questions such as:

* Why did they get started with the topic in the first place?
* Are they still curious/excited about the topic, if so/not then why?
* What are the biggest misconceptions people have about the topic?
* What types of questions are they always asked or see asked?
* What is really cool about the topic?
* What's really hard or needs to change?
* Where do they send beginners when they ask for help?
* What tools, systems, or libraries do they use when the use the topic on a project?
* What types of projects have they used the topic on in the past?

Use email, google form, or zoom.

Perhaps start with the 3 most important questions, then expand if they engage.

Read all of their stuff and call it out in the ask email.

Record all answers and get permission to make the material public in the future, if you decide to go forward.

The result will be good content that will help to inform the pillar posts and other material going forward. It may also be quotable.

You will also get a feeling for what it is like to interact with skilled developers that work on the topic.

* Are they the kind of people you want to talk to and help?
* Can you see yourself helping people like that in the future?
* How can you turn intermediate developers into the people like those you have interviewed?

You will also start to build real relationships to people in the field.

This may help later when you want to get feedback on your pillar posts, products, and more.



## Website Model and Structure

You must seriously consider the material you want to make public and the structure you want to use for the site.

Don't assume a specific model or structure, consciously choose one. Then challenge whether is the best decision.

Considerations for the model might include:

* How much free content do you publish?
* What free content appears in the paid content?
* What form does free content take?
* What medium is used for free content?
* What is the job of the free content?

This deeply matters.

You don't want to produce vast amounts of content that does not have a clear purpose. Content with a clear purpose moves you closer to your goals, a lack of clear process is a waste of time and effort.

You need to know that each new piece of content is contributing to the whole, that you are incrementally building a valuable asset.

For example:

* Perhaps each posted tutorial is used as a chapter in a technical book.
* Perhaps short public code recipes can be expanded into a tutorial for a book.
* Perhaps only large pillar tutorials are published.
* Perhaps helping readers and question answering is only performed off site.
* Perhaps only code recipes, or notebooks, or code files are published publicly.
* Perhaps only video series or podcast series are published for free.

What are the products and what is the content marketing?

There's no right or best way.

Some more ways to think about the same decision:

* **Theme Based**. Select a theme and write tutorial on the theme that are published for free and contribute directly to a product on the theme.
* **Content Based**. Write content across a range of themes and let engagement determine the focus and composition of a product.
* **Product Based**. Carefully design a hero product offline then design content marketing material that promotes the product.

The risk of theme-based approach is in choosing the right themes and paid and free content are the same. The risk of content-based approach is in the vast amount of content required before a focus emerges due to engagement and the competing concerns that may arise. The risk of the product-based approach is in the design and composition of the hero product.

It is reasonable to use ideas from all three methods. Such as select themes and write tutorials that will become a book. Some tutorials can be published and pieces and extensions of tutorials that don't appear in the paid products can be posted. Additionally, shorter off topic content can be created and published at the same time. This approach would allow a pipeline of hero-like smaller products to be created and for engagement to surface new ideas. It assumes you want to be immersed in the topic for a long time to come.

Review the top authority sites that rank for your topic or parent topics and analyze and record their models and structures. They probably work to some degree and are a good start, rather than devising something from scratch.

Select an approach and carefully specify it in as much detail as you can stand. It may change later. List procedures you would follow. It may help to pretend that you would hire writers and consider the procedures you will teach them to follow in order to create the website and business outcomes you require.

Think through the processes and activities required to create and public content and paid products for each. For example, do you need to develop and publish content every day, or just at the beginning and keep things up to date. Does the content require constant maintenance, do the products?

If you had an unlimited budget, what would you do exactly. Write it all out.

You don't have to get into the specific product type or product suite yet, just a high-level idea of perhaps the type of products you might want to consider, e.g. probably digital products like books and courses instead of in-person events like conferences and workshops.

Reflect on the candidates.

* Which looks like the most fun?
* Which looks like too much work?
* Which will be most valuable for developers in your niche?
* Which would be easiest to hire-for and to sell as a packaged business?
* Which might be enticing to a big company as a strategic purchase and why?



## Decision Point

A lot of hard work has been done and you have some work products and strong opinions on your topic.

It's time to decide whether to start building out a site or you shelve the idea.

Are you still interested? Do you want to go all in and become the worlds best at creating content on your topic? Think hard about this.

Some useful thought exercises might be:

* Would you be proud to go to a conference and stand on stage and speak an expert on the topic (eventually)?
* Would you be proud to have a book in a bookshop/amazon on your topic with your name on the front?
* Would you be proud to tell all your professional friends and colleagues that you are an expert on your topic?
* Would you be happy talking to and helping developers with your topic for the next few years?

It's an emotional decision, not logical or financial. Be okay with that. You're a human with curiosity and ego, not a robot. Any pretty much any small niche is enough to support a developer salary if you can hustle.

If you are still into the topic after all of this, then it's time to build out the site.

Otherwise circle back and start with another topic. The research process will be much faster this time around.

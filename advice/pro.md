# Be an authority site professional

Stop.

What would a professional do?

* If you were hired do run the site, what would that look like?
* If you were being trained to run the site, what would that involve?
* If you were defining the role, what would you expect?

You do the same critical tasks every day. What are they?
You have a quota for things to do each day week that move the business forward. What is the quota?

Okay, that's easy. What else?

Training.

Professionals are trained.

They must stay on top of the field.

This involves:

* Reading books.
* Watching YouTube videos.
* Following and reading experts on Twitter.
* Taking notes and reflecting.
* Generating ideas for tests to run.
* Breaking down other sites to see what works and can be borrowed.

It might also mean other things, like:

* Coaching to fix or address some area of weakness, some lack of skill.
* Third party audits.

It also means hanging around other experts in the same area, for example:

* Masterminds
* Conferences

And so on...

Is this really your thing? Authority sites?

If so, take it seriously.

Consider what a professional would do, then do that.

You've already started.

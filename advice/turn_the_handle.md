# Turn the Handle

Design a system, then turn the handle ever day.

One turn of the handle is one day.

One turn of the handle makes the business better.

* It helps the readers.
* It improves the marketing.
* It leads to more sales.
* It makes the business grow.
* It puts more revenue in the bank account.

The system must be well defined.

The activities of the system must be carefully chosen to achieve these outcomes, even in the smallest possible way at first.

The system and its activities must be continually optimized. Not automated per se, but optimized to better achieve the objectives.

If the system is well designed and if the handle is turned every day, then it is impossible not to succeed.

I think the outputs would be something like:

1. All support queries are handled within one day.
2. A tutorial is published every day or every second day.
3. Published tutorials are promoted on social media.
4. An email newsletter is sent every week.
5. A book is published every month or every second or third month.

I think the daily activities of the system looks something like:

1. Reply to all email, be as helpful as possible and have the last word.
2. Write the draft of one tutorial.
3. Publish (or schedule) one tutorial publicly.
4. Promote any tutorials that have been published.
5. Work on and progress the current book project.

Turn the handle.

Never not be turning the handle.

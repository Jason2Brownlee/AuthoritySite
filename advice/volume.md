We have no idea what will work.

We make guess.
We can do all the research.
We can make educated guesses.
In the end, we have no idea.

We must test.

Every tutorial is a test.
Every lead magnet is a test.
Every email course is a test.
Every product is a test.

Eventually we will find things that work.

Then double down.

Do more of what works.

Leave the ego behind.
You don't know what will work.
Discover what topics work by testing.

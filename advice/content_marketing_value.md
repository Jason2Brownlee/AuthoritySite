# Content Marketing Value

You are doing content marketing.

The idea is to have content that will provide a logical lead in to your associated product.

There must be a logical link.

You must have calls to action for your products.

How do you measure the performance of content?

Ultimately, it must be the number of purchases of the product.

In practice, it is disjoint:

1. Read n articles
2. Get on list
3. Get some emails
4. Read more articles
5. Buy product

It takes a while to build trust.

Nevertheless, the value of the content is the number of products it sells.

The value of each topic can be evaluated in this way.

1. How much traffic is falling on the content?
2. How many clicks to product pages?
3. How many purchases of products?

From this we can calculate per-page and per-topic conversion rates and values.

Once we have these numbers, we might decide to do more for some topics than others.

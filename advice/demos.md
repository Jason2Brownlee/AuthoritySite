# Content Marketing as Demos

The tutorials are a type of content marketing.

We provide free helpful tutoruals that solve real problems for developers.

The developers use the tutorials to solve problems and/or learn something and trust the source.

Each tutorial is a demo for the product (books/information products).

They show what is possible with the product (if the content of the product was known).

Each tutorial published is one more demo.

The more demos, the more opportunities to transition readers into customers.

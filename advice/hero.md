# Hero Product

My default is to write and publish many books.

It's a lot to maintain.

Why not have a hero product instead of n separate products?

* Have one high-price product.
* One offer that you drive everyone to purchase
* One sales page

It is a good idea.

Ties in with "$100M Offers".

Ties in to Taki Moore's "Five Ones":  one person/problem, one product, one conversion tool, one traffic source, one year => one million dollars.

But to square this with the idea of writing content that appears in books.

If you don't have a series of books, why write so much content?

I have been thinking about this for a long time, e.g.:

* [One Product](https://www.jamesschramko.com/sales-marketing-profit/6-one-product)
* [The Roll Up](https://www.jamesschramko.com/sales-marketing-profit/12-the-roll-up)
* [Five Ones](https://www.jamesschramko.com/sales-marketing-profit/17-five-ones)

# Unbundle

Picking a niche is about unbundling another book.

Take a book on Python, select one chapter, that is a niche.

Each section and subsection of the chapter is a book/course/category

That is what we are doing here, unbundling.

Transform a tiny but impprtant and overlooked topic into a whole world.

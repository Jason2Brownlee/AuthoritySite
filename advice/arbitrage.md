# We are doing arbitrage

The audience don't know how.
You figure out how.
You show them how, faster than they can figure out themselves.
That is valuable.

It is an arbitrage between people that need to know and the technical docs that contain the information.

We sit in between the need and the information and figure out the how and make it easy to understand and copy-paste into new projects.

This is valuable.

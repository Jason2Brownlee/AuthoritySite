# Sales Funnel


## Develop a Sales Funnel

The sales funnel is as follows:

1. Prospects have a problem.
2. They search on google and arrive on a tutorial.
3. They sign-up for the mini-course on the topic.
4. The mini-course drives them to the sales pages for the product.
5. The product drives them to an order form on the shopping cart to complete the purchase.
6. They receive a follow-up email sequence.


```default
[problem] -> [google] -> [tutorial] -> [mini-course] -> [sales page] -> [shopping cart] -> [converted]
```

or

```default
[problem] -> [google] -> [tutorial] -> [sales page] -> [shopping cart] -> [converted]
```

The process could be shorter if they decide to purchase directly from the tutorial, instead of the mini course.

The shopping cart could be embedded on the sales page or appear as a pop-up.

Alternately, the prospect joins the main list and hangs around for a while, getting to know, like and trust the authority site.

```default
[problem] -> [google] -> [tutorial] -> [main-list] -> [tutorial(s)...] -> [shopping cart] -> [converted]
```

## Increased Revenue

The sales funnel can be revised to increase the revenue.

### Increase cart value

The sales page can offer tiers, such as a the product, the product and a small bundle, and the product with a large bundle.

```default
[sales page]
	-> [tier 1 shopping cart]
	-> [tier 2 shopping cart]
	-> [tier 3 shopping cart]
```

The shopping cart can offer an order bump which is a complementary product added to the order.

The shopping cart can also offer one-time offers (up-sells) and down-sells.

```default
[sales page] -> [shopping cart] -> [one time offer 1] -> [one time offer 2]
                                                      -> [down sell offer]
```

There are many variations on this that could be explored.


### Increase purchase frequency

The follow-up email sequence can ask for a review which can be used for social proof later. It can also ask for recommendations, offer discounts on future purchases, posts to social media and more.

Additional follow-up email sequences can be used to up-sell and cross-sell related products.


## Drive traffic

A sales page abandonment sequence can be used to offer a sample chapter or a mini-course on the topic.

A checkout abandonment offer can be added to offer a discount code.

Retargeting ads can also be used to drive prospects back to the sales page.


## Additional tips

I like to use a third-party shopping cart like SamCart because it can be optimized for conversion.

Alternately, you can use GumRoad either off-site or as an embedded widget or pop-up.

Another alternative is to use woo commerce or shoplift and have a shopping cart that supports multiple purchases on site. I looked into this and it appeared to limit what you could do with your long form sales letter.

## Improvements

You could drive traffic directly to a squeeze page with a lead magnet, then offer products on the follow-up sequence.

This will provide an alternative to google / seo as a traffic source and make the business more robust to google shocks.

The thank-you page after getting the lead magnet / mini-course could make an offer. This will help sort out who are buyers much sooner.

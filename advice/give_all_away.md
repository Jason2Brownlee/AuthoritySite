# Give It All Away

Give everything away for free.

All the material. Not the products.

It is the BEST form of marketing.

Selling is just a remix of the same information.

* new arrangements
* learning paths
* formats
* form factors

The product makes it easier to understand, complete, apply.

But everything is already out there.

And this is okay.

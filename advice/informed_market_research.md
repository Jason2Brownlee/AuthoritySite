# Informed Market Research

Informed market research is when we look out into the world to see what it thinks about the topic, from a very-high level.

The goal here is to find all the relevant places, people, and products related to the topic. We want to record all of this discovery in a way that we can leverage later, such as adding to the lists, and using the data as the basis of marketing.

I recommend creating a google spreadsheet with one tab for each aspect.



## Places

Identify all the places online that someone interested in this topic might chat, or someone having problems with this topic might ask for help or complain.

The best places to look include

* StackOverflow tags.
* SubReddits
* Quora tags.
* GoodReads, lists, groups, and shelves.
* Twitter hashtags.

Other good places include

* Facebook groups.
* Linkedin groups.
* Google groups or usenet.
* Forums.
* Google Searches, for each synonym

Record each in a spreadsheet with as much information as possible, including name, URL, number of messages, and more. Separate into groups by the source and order each group by the total number of messages, if available.

We will mine these locations for content and marketing ideas, such as problems, confusions, questions, pains, and more.

Bonus, identify places that are at one level above the topic, that is, the parent topic. There is a good chance that these will be a gold mine of content ideas. For example, if the topic is "python logging" find places online where people go to discuss "python programming". Also, consider logging for other languages or platforms, e.g. "java logging".


## Products

Identify all of the resources that someone may use to get help on the topic.

Think of a product as anything a developer may purchase, hire, or use to do a job for them on the topic, either directly or indirectly.

These are your competitors and collaborators.

These might include:

* Books, including amazon, goodreads, book resource pages.
* Video courses, such as udemy, pluralsight.
* University courses, from the university directly and platforms like coursera.
* Workshops, accelerators, bootcamps.

Also look advertisements for the following platforms:

* Google search for keywords.
* YouTube search for keywords.
* Amazon search for keywords.
* Twitter search for keywords.

Record in a spreadsheet as much as you can including, title, subtitle, URL, price, number of review/purchases, etc. For books and courses that may be available from multiple vendors, perhaps record each link, as they may be a source of useful reviews later (e.g. what people like or dislike about the product).

Bonus, identify products that belong to a parent topic. For example, if your topic is "python logging", then books and courses on "logging" may cover theory and be helpful, and resources on "java logging" might have useful ideas later.



## Keywords

Identify and record the relevant keywords and the keywords you might like to target.

Log into the "Google Keywords Planner" tool, part of the "Google Ads" platform. You may have to create an account.

Click "Discover new keywords" and enter the topic name and synonyms, then click the results.

Add the country to "United States". Sort by "Avg. monthly searches".

Download as a CSV file and add as a tab to your google sheet.

Review the list, prune keywords that do not make sense and identify the 5-10 keywords for which you like to rank.

Target keywords may be:

* Exact match for topic
* 500 or more monthly average searches
* Competition index of 3 or above

The goal will be to have hubs, pillar content, and products on the top keywords. All keywords above 500 searches must have content and the rest may provoke ideas for content.



## Content

Identify the major content on the topic.

First, search in google for the topic and synonyms. Bonus points for using the target keywords. Record all of the large pillar blog posts and major blog-based tutorials that people will find and use as reference.

Record the title, author, URL and number of comments if available. I recommend using an incognito browser window and google.com (not localized) to avoid any google account specific results.

Perhaps just the first 5-10 most relevant tutorials for each query.

* Pillar blog posts.
* Study guides.
* Cheat sheets.

You will start to see trends such as authors with more than one tutorial, domains that have a series of tutorials on the topic, and the types of titles and content freshness that google is rewarding.

Later, as you dig deeper, you will find many more blog-based tutorials. Add them to the list also.

Now repeat for videos.

* Video tutorials, YouTube.

Next, find out what top developers are talking about when it comes to the topic and what types of tutorials do well for content marketing. Search on hacker news for the topic and all synonyms and record each title, date, number of comments, and votes and the URL.

This may be recorded on separate tab.

Only consider posts on the first page of results, e,g. top 10-20 with many comments and up-votes.

Reading these comments later will give lots of useful links, strong opinions, emotions, and biases. You can also see what is not working, those posts that have no engagement.

* HackerNews.
* Reddit.
* Twitter.

Next, record code libraries on the topic. Perhaps in a separate tab.

This might include standard libraries, API documentation, and open source software that provides an alternate or enhancement to the standard libraries.

Capture the type of software (open source, stdlib, etc.), the module name (in code), the name of the library, the number of stars (on GitHub, if relevant) and the URL. Also capture the official homepage and document page if relevant.

* Code APIs, API documentation, etc.
* GitHub
* Code libraries.

Finally record reference information such as Wikipedia articles. Again, this may be a new tab.

These will be articles on parent topics and jargon words. It will be important to know this information as background and to link to the relevant articles. You may want to compete for some of the keywords that the articles go after.

* Wikipedia pages, portals.




## People

Identify all the people that are experts on the topic, or have something to say publicly about the topic.

These are the authorities and influencers on your topic.

This might include:

* Twitter
* Book authors.
* Blog authors.
* Code library authors.
* API authors.
* Large blog post authors.
* Tutorial authors.
* Conference presenters.
* Workshop presenters.
* University course teachers.
* Online course teachers.
* Video authors.
* Podcast authors.

Record each in a spreadsheet including full name, nick name, social media, contact information, reason for authority.

We will attempt to build a relationship with all of these people, including interviews, advice, quotes, beta readers, and more.

Bonus, identify people that are experts on a broader topic as they will be an excellent resource. For example, if the topic is "python logging", then authorities on "logging" more generally or "java logging" will be helpful to know.


## Jargon

You are going to start to see a lot of jargon.

These are technical terms that have a specific meaning in the niche.

They will be confusing to a beginner and are the types of words you might see in a glossary of terms.

For example, if your topic is "python logging" you will see lots of logging based jargon such as "log level", "log file", "log event", and so on. You might be able to spot all the nouns on a help forum for the topic and record them as jargon.

Create a new spreadsheet tab called "jargon" and add all of these terms. No need to define them yet, just list them all. Don't worry about duplicates, we can sort the list later and delete the duplicates.

We can create a definition page for each or a glossary of terms later as a product.


## Jobs

Are there any jobs on the topic.

The topic may be too specialized for companies to hire directly for the skill. Instead, there may be higher-level jobs that call out for the skill.

Identify these roles. Visit top job sites and search for the topic and variations. I recommend using the US version of the sites or select the United States as the search region.

Record the number of jobs that mention the topic as well as the types of roles.

This will give insight into how companies and hiring managers see the skill and the words they use when hiring.

The language used will bias towards specific types of roles.


## Pause

That's it for now.

You will now have the basis for really digging into the niche and discovering the opportunities.

You also have a system for recording anything interesting you come across.

Record everything for now, you have no idea what will be useful in the future, and you don't want to have to cover the same ground.

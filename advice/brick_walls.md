# Brick Walls

It's good when things don't work.

* A tutorial is not widely read.
* A book does not result in sales
* Visitors don't sign up for an email course/
* A lead magnet does not get clicks.
* A topic is not interesting to visitors.

I think of something not working as a physical brick wall.

I am standing on one side and what I want to happen is on the other side.

I need to find a way past. Over the top.

I have to try many things to get there.

It just so happens that the first thing I tried didn't work.

So try more things.

I need to scrutinize every little thing. This always turns up things that were wrong and need fixing.

Get over the wall.

Imagine if the first thing tried did work.

This would be TERRIBLE!

Think of all the thinking and learning that would not happen as a result.

Brick walls are good.

They are the normal thing.

They are how we improve.

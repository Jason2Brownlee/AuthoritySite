# Business Artifacts

Most of the artifacts of the business are disposable.

These are things like:

* SOPs
* Products
* Market research
* Survey summary and analysis

They are just google docs and GitHub repositories.

Take the time to turn research into artifacts.

Perhaps a blog post to help readers.
Perhaps a report for the business.

Print all internal reports and docs and put them in a folder.
Keep them real and honest. Take them seriously.

Work on them. Improve them.

Create hard copies of all books and put them in the book case.

It makes it hard to delete the work one day when the winds change.

I know from experience a lot of the early market research from the last business was lost. It was good stuff that could have been incrementally improved. Instead it was deleted and was re-invented each time for a worse result.

Treat the job as though you were hiring someone dedicated to do it. Then do it like that with the required outputs.

# Flywheel

A flywheel is hard to get stated, it takes a of energy. One spinning, it does not take much to keep it spinning.

Writing daily tutorials is a flywheel.

It is hard to get started.
It's hard to make writing a daily habit.

Once it is a daily habit, it does not take much to keep it going.

Just keep writing one tutorial per day, no matter what.

* Each new tutorial makes the site better.
* Each new tutorial makes the business bigger.
* Each new tutorial is a new door way that readers can find your business.
* Each new tutorial is a new test to see what people need help with.

Many tutorials on a topic together are a qualitatively different thing.

* A collection of tutorials give topical authority.
* A collection of tutorials can be used as the basis for a course, a book, or some other product.

There is no downside to writing and publishing daily tutorials.

Just keep the flywheel spinning.

# why not video?

Passive vs active + relationship building.

Video could play a part.

Ideas:

## video content
make a short video for the top 5-10 posts in each category
embed in content
add to channel

## video sales letter
create a short video for each product
does not have to be full vsl
just describe the book features and benefits

## video welcome
welcome to the site

## video about
about the author and the site

## video series
pick a topic or category and record a short series
could be code examples
could be video lecture

## send a video to each customer
thanks and here to help if you have questions

## ask for video reviews from each customer
post to social
post to youtube
add to site

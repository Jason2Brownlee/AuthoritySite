# The Model

The business is a training or education publishing company.

It starts with a technical topic for developers that is underserved.

This may be because:

* The topic is complex and messy.
* The existing information is dispersed and incomplete.
* There are few or no thought leaders on the topic.

The topic is also challenging, interesting, or fun in some way.

Together, these properties of the topic are a wonderful opportunity.

We dig into the topic and map out the niche.

We identify a large number of subtopics that become the basis for training programs, such as ebooks and courses comprised of tutorials.

We then write the tutorials and post them for free to a blog as content marketing.

Tutorials are gathered up into products and launched.

We use email marketing to warm up visitors to the content marketing and convert them into customers of the training products.

There are perhaps five main areas of this model to discuss, they are:

1. Choosing a niche. Market research and mapping of a technical topic or "niche".
2. Setting up the website. Architect a website to host content marketing and sell information products.
3. Writing tutorials. Create world-class technical tutorials.
4. Creating products. Convert technical tutorials into information products.
5. Sales and marketing. Create sales funnels and drive traffic.

This is called an authority site business.

There are many ways to build this type of business, but I will outline the approach that I took, updated based on what I learned operating a business for about eight years.

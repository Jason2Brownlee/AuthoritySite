# GitHub Marketing

Github can be used for marketing.

This is because developers spend a lot of time on the platform and generally trust it more than raw google results.

For example, create a repo for many different purposes:

* host tutorial code
* host book code
* awesome repos
	* books / products / courses
	* libraries
	* stdlib

These will be free products that are super useful.

They can be used to drive traffic back to main site.

Other people are just going to pirate the stuff anyway, may as well be the source.

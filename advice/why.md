# Why?

Imagine a technical topic.

A "programming topic" + "programming language", for example:

* logging in java
* deployment with rust
* GIUs with python
* etc.

Now imagine you had an online monopoly for that topic.

What is a monopoly? In this case, it is the pseudo exclusive control or supply of information on the topic. The go-to resource.

Then what?

Well, developers always come to you when:

* They need to get started with the topic.
* They need a to copy-paste a code snippet.
* They have a question.
* They need a tutorial on an API feature.
* They need a book.
* They need a course.
* etc.

Winning means you keep winning, as long as there are systems there to collect new questions, new APIs, new problems, all the new needs.

What would that mean for you?

* You would be internationally known as an authority.
* You can help developers from all over the world with the topic.
* You can sell your own or other peoples books and courses.
* You can consult on the topic.
* You can coach on the topic.
* You can be a keynote speaker on the topic at conferences.
* etc.

What will that mean for developers?

* They have an oracle that answers all of their questions on a tricky technical topic.
* They always have a trusted resource to turn to.
* They have a person, not a company, they they know will help.
* They can work faster, get more done, achieve outcomes, get results, all the good stuff.
* etc.

What would that mean for other businesses?

* Publishes will want you to author chapters and books on the topic.
* Book authors will want you to review and promote their books.
* Course writers will want you to review and promote their courses.
* Startups in your area will want to promote their products and services.
* Companies will want to hire you for your expertise.
* etc.

This is why we are doing it.

This is the focus of this work.

This is what we are building, why we are building, and who we are building it for.

It is service and all parties win.

The unattainable goal where everyone wins is:

* Develop and operate an authority site is a monopoly on a specific technical topic.

The more narrowly specific the technical topic, the easier the monopoly, but perhaps the fewer people that can be served.

Not being a monopoly means you have work to do. You don't deserve it. Other's have better material than you.

* Own the topic.
* Own the mind share.

What would this take?

What do you need to do?
How hard are you going to have to work?
How kick-ass amazing are your tutorials going to have to be?

What would that mean to you?

This is the strategy. The rest is just tactical detail.

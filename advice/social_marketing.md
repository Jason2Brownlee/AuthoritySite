# Social Media Marketing

What about social media?

The authority site is the main show.

Any work off site is designed to bring readers back to the authority site.

This means that we can suggest on the site to follow on social media. It does not mean that we want to drive traffic away from our site back to social.

Social is good for distributing content from the main site in order to bring people back.

Tools can be used to automatically share new tutorials on platforms like LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook.

Tutorials can also be shared in relevant LinkedIn groups, Facebook Groups and news aggregators like reddit and hacker news.

It may also be helpful to automatically share older tutorials from the catalog on social media.

Social can also be used to promote sales and new books, such as with a pinned message.


## Improvements

YouTube could be used to create an additional content channel to drive traffic back to the site.

Perhaps a Q&A show, long form tutorials, or similar.

A Podcast can also be used as an additional content channel much like video.

Other sales channels could be treated like content channel, e.g. short Kindle books on the Amazon ecosystem.

Open source could also be used as a content channel offering code examples or an open source library.

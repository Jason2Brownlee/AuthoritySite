# Boring

Sometimes a post feels boring.

This has a physical effect.

* It's hard to finish writing.
* It's hard to edit.
* It's hard to publish.
* It's hard to promote.

If a piece is boring to write, it will be boring to read.

If it's hard, it's probably wrong.

Focus on what is interesting.

Only write the interesting parts.

Only write the interesting topics.

Leave everything else.

Sometimes this may mean finding the interesting angle.

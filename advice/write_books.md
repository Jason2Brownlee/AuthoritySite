## Write Books

How do you write a technical book?

The hard work of the technical books is writing the tutorials. This is already done as part of building out the website.

Editing and selling the book is much simpler.



## Topic

Select a topic.

The topic must be large enough for a product.

Maybe large enough that other publishers have a book on the topic. Ideally small enough or specialized enough that other publishes have not covered it yet and maybe never will.

Ideally, you're getting a lot of questions about the topic.

This might require that you write about the topic first to generate the interest and the questions.

In fact, we write about topics with the assumption that we will also write a book on it.


## Content

The content is taken from tutorials.

Every tutorial written is a front door to the business/website and a candidate for a chapter in the book on the topic.

This way, writing a tutorial is the most valuable thing you can be doing every day.

This approach allows ideas to be tested first.

Any feedback from readers can be used to improve the tutorial and in turn the book. E.g. confusing sections, confusing code, etc.

It allows chances to be taken in tutorials that are interesting but might not be a good fit for the book. This is really important. The book structure may be too confining early on. Taking chances might open up ideas for tutorials or even whole parts of the book not previously considered.

The book design must be allowed to breathe and evolve as more is learned about the topic and how to best present problems and solutions in the context of APIs and open source libraries that are available.

For example, maybe everything has to be coded from scratch, maybe there is a library that has everything you could ever need, maybe a mixture is required to both understand the methods and apply the methods, and so on.


## Size

The book has to solve a problem for the reader.

Maybe you can solve a small problem in 10-20 or 50 pages.

Maybe it takes 100, 200 or even 500 pages.

The price of the book is not related to the number of pages, it is related to the value to the reader.

Make the book long enough to solve the central problem for the reader.


## Tutorials

Write the tutorials first, mostly.

Do your homework.

Read or skim through all of the resources on the topic, such as:

* Developer books
* Academic books
* Review papers
* Websites
* Open source projects

Building theses lists of resources and sub topics is also content for the blog, e.g. what are the best review papers on ..., what are the best books on ..., etc. These are tutorials to write based on research performed.

List all candidate tutorials in a spreadsheet and organize them into rough subsections or parts they might form in a book.

Continually add to the list and reorganize the structure until it feels right or the book is launched.

Any content not in the book goes into the category "research", a catch-all. helps you track what has been written and what is and out of scope of the product.

Maybe most stuff goes in the book, maybe not. Nothing is wasted.

The semi-structured approach will expose areas or ideas not covered.

Each tutorial can suggest 3-5 extensions. These may also end up as topics for future tutorials.


## Mini-Course

To help with this process, design a 7-day or 14-day mini course you could teach on the topic.

This will be the basis of a mini course lead magnet later, e.g. an email course or lead nurturing campaign.

It helps because it forces you to think through what is important and what is not important. What the reader really needs to know. It also helps clarify the category name and book title.

This course is what you might use as the basis for teaching a workshop on the topic to a class over 5 to 10 days.

The actual mini course will be a lite version of the product.

Typically just 7 key things to know how to do, where each lesson is a brief introduction and tiny code example that runs.

Each lesson should fit on page or in an email, within reason.

It is a really good idea to design this early, but perhaps write last or later once you are a master of the topic. The lessons can be copy-pasted right out of relevant tutorials and can link to those tutorials.

The course itself can also be posted to the block as a tutorial.

If awesome, even given away as a lead magnet or sold for a few dollars.


## Frontmatter and Backmatter

The front and back matter are all written last along with the mini course and sales page.

It requires a different mindset, specifically a sales mindset rather than a teaching mindset.

The book must be sold and resold to the reader. Even after they've purchased it. Even after they have started reading it.

The preface explains why I (we) wrote the book, but really sells the book and the author as the teacher.

The introduction sells the book, (e.g. PAS structure or problem, agitate, solve) with the book contents as the solution.

The back matter is resources like books and APIs to visit to get more help and review of what was learned.


## formatting

The book is built in latex using a standard template that is consistent with all other books in the catalog.

Alternatively, the book can be formatted using markdown and compiled into all the formats using a tool like pandoc.

The books are all the same. Or, at least all the books in a series are all the same. Same cover design, same internal design, same teaching style.

I like lots of white space on the blog, but less white space in the book. The medium dictates the formatting.


## Editing

Little actual editing of the content is needed as the tutorials themselves will have been edited prior to being published on the blog.

While piecing the book together, you will get ideas of topics that were missed, redundancy that can be deleted and more.

Having all the book in your head at one time helps a lot.

The book is put together and edited over a few rounds:

1. Put all of the tutorials into the right format, perform internal design, create first draft.
2. Read through book cover to cover and make corrections.
3. provide to beta readers and make corrections.

It should then be ready to sell.


## Launch

Coordinate the development of the book and writing and publishing of tutorials on the topic.

The stream of tutorials should warm up the audience on the topic and provoke discussion and questions.

Announce the book half way through the stream of tutorials on the topic.

Launch the book close to the end of the stream of tutorials on the topic have been published.

This will ensure maximum interest.

Disconnecting the launch of a book on a topic not currently being written about on the blog may require more and different warning up of the audience and readership.


## Maintenance

Each tutorial will collect feedback in terms of comments and emails.

After sale, many readers will have feedback on the book in terms of typos and errors.

These can all be collected and actioned to update the book and the tutorials on the blog. It might be helpful to maintain this work in a kanban board.

APIs will change and version numbers will change.

It is a good idea to re-test all code examples every year to confirm they all work, and update as needed to remove any warning messages.

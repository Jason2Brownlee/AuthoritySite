# Success

I've had some success with authority sites over the years.

I have:

* Written 1,500+ of pieces of content / tutorials.
* Published 30+ technical books.
* Received many millions of pageviews per month.
* Sold many millions of dollars of digital products.
* Sold a business for many millions of dollars.

Some of my sites over the years:

* [CleverAlgorithms](https://web.archive.org/web/20130120074424/CleverAlgorithms.com), 2011-2012 ([archived](https://github.com/clever-algorithms/CleverAlgorithms))
* [MobileGameEngines](https://web.archive.org/web/20131108154500/http://mobilegameengines.com/) 2012-2013 ([archived](https://github.com/Jason2Brownlee/MobileGameEngines))
* [MachineLearningMastery](https://MachineLearningMastery.com), 2013-2021 (sold)
* [SuperFastPython](https://SuperFastPython.com), 2021-current

It took me about 5 years from starting to "figure it out" and earn enough to retire from my day job in 2016.

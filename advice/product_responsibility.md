# Product is a Responsibility

You have a responsibility to the readers to create and release a product on the topic.

You wrote 50+ tutorials on the topic.

You become a world expert on the topic, one of tens of people who know as much about the topic as you.

Readers find the material and are impressed.

The tutorials create trust with the reader:

* They solve problems
* They are helpful
* They are real, not spun content
* There are many of them
* They are reader focused, not writer focused

Readers want to learn from you about the topic, but its hard:

* Where do they start?
* What is the order?
* What is required and what is nice to have?
* What is the learning path?

They want you to lay it all out for them.

You have a responsibility to create a product for them to help them learn the topic to the level that you know it. It is too hard for them otherwise.

Take your responsibility seriously.

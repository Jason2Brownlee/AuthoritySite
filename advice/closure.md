# Closure

Creating a product for a topic gives you closure.

And this is important for mental health.

* It allows you to pass on everything you learned on the topic.
* It allows you to point to a single thing that captures what you know.
* It allows you to move on.

Moving on is key.

We cannot dwell. There is more to do.

Get closure then move on to the next topic.

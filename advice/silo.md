# Silo Structure

Develop the site using the silo design structure.

Each topic has a hub page and many small pages.

The small pages are low competition and get traffic and support the hub page.

The hub page seeks to win the main keyword in the topic cluster and may make offers.

Categories are logical, not physical in the URL structure. They are defined by linking.

Each silo (category) can have specific products, email campaigns, lead magnets, etc.

For each silo:

* Answer all the questions
* Cover all the topics

Can have multiple target pages in a silo, not just one.

This helps with SEO. It helps to win SERPs.

It helps with the reader, leading them back to a main hub page.

It helps with site design.

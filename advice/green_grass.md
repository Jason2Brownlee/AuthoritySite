# Green Grass

You will have other ideas.

The grass will always seem greener.
It isn't, it's just different.

If you have other ideas, write them out.
Exorcise them, otherwise they will fester.

Get to the point where you can see that it will be just as hard as what you are doing now.

* Create a folder.
* Create one doc per idea.
* Capture all the ideas.
* Capture all the research, the google trends, the keywords, all of it.

Get it out of your system.

It might take an hour.
It might take a day.
Get it all out.

Then get back to work.

# Work Anyway

Sometimes the site will be really popular.

Sometimes traffic will fall off due to a google algorithm change.

Sometimes people will email really kind words.

Sometimes comments on reddit will be vicious.

Sometimes sales will be up.

Sometimes sales will be down.

Sometimes the niche will feel like rolling green fields.

Sometimes the niche will feel like a cage.

Sometimes the tutorials will be exciting.

Sometimes writing will feel like complete drudgery.

Sometimes the niche will feel like the new hotness.

Sometimes the niche will feel old and tired and irrelevant.

Expect the ups and downs.

Work anyway.

Don't stop.

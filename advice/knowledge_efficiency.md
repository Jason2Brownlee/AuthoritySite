# Knowledge vs Efficiency

Don't try to educate developers about what they should know or should be doing.

Instead, help them do what they are already doing, just do it faster, better, cheaper.

This is called "The Knowledge Gap Fallacy" or the "Knowledge Gap vs. The Efficiency Gap".

We are expects and teaching developers "the way" is our default approach. It is also a much harder business to build.

It is MUCH easier to develop a business that helps developers do what they are already doing. No education is required. Little risk on your or their part. The outcome is known and desired.

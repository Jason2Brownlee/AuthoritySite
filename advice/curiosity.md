# Curiosity is perishable

You will feel the tug of curiosity.

* Why...
* What if...
* How...


If you feel the tug, you must follow it.

Right now.
Don't wait.

* Research the question, and write it up.
* Write the code experiment, and write it up.
* Check the API, and write it up.

If you're curious, others will be too.

They will have the same questions.

BUT, you must act upon it immediately.

Do one thing.
Write it down.
Sketch the idea.
Take at least one step in the direction.

Like Naval says, inspiration is perishable, but so is curiosity and curiosity is our engine.

# Create a destination

The goal is to be the destination for the topic.

* It is the place everyone points to when someone on the team has a problem on the topic.
* It provides a summary better than any other book or website.
* It provides access to solutions more efficiently than even the API docs.
* It provides code that is ready to use.
* It is more helpful.
* It is the place where people that are interested in the topic want to hang out.

Create "the" place.

The place where they want to come during their lunch break to check what is happening.

The place to which they want to subscribe so that they don't miss out on new tutorials and new books.

The place where they care about the topics that will be covered next.

The place where they want to know more about the people behind the site.

Build the destination.

# Mining

Its like mining.

You start off with empty unclaimed land.

* You start digging, each aspect of the API is one area.
* You mine the entire API.
* All the functions.
* All the arguments.
* All the questions you might have.
* All the questions other might have.
* All the errors that might occur.

You mine the entire thing and move on to the next piece of land.

Keep mining until you run out of areas to mine.

Probe the API. Like unit testing it.

Demonstrate each common use case.

Answer all the questions you can think of.

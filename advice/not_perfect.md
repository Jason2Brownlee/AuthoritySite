# Not Perfect

Write great tutorials.

Tutorials that are helpful.

Make the tutorials better over time.

Nevertheless, the tutorials won't be perfect.

* They may have spelling errors.
* They may have grammar mistakes.
* They may have factual errors.
* They may have buggy code.

We do our best, but sometimes errors sneak in.

They must. We write so much. It's just probability.

Fix them as soon as they are found.

The errors don't matter.

The tutorials are helpful regardless of errors.

The readers need help now.

There is nowhere else to turn.

The tutorials are like dispatches from the front. From the bleeding edge.

Readers just need help in order to progress their project.

If the tutorials really are helpful, readers will overlook small errors.

This applies to tutorials and products.

# Sales Page Basics

What should be included in the sales page?

I think long-form sales pages work for developers.

They have lots of questions and what to read.


## Page Elements

The top of the page should be like a small amazon page with elements such as the cover, the title, the price and a link to the purchase area of the page.

It must also have technical info such as what they will get in the package, the number of source code files, the number of pages in the PDF.

The sales page can be structured using PAS: problem, agitate, solve. The solution to the problem is the book.

The page must clearly state who the book is for and who it is not for.

The page must clearly call out standard objections and address them.

There must be a section on the author why they have the expertise to write this book.

The page must clearly state learning outcomes.

It can then have full table of contents, sample chapters, sample pages, and so on.

There must be tiers offering the book, the book in a bundle, a bundle of everything.

There must be a FAQ at the bottom that answers all customer questions.

There must be a money back guarantee.

There must be social proof in the form of reviews and logos of companies whose employees have purchased in the past.

There must be some urgency about why now is the time to learn the topic.

There must be a comparison of other ways to solve the problem that are more expensive and less effective.

It is a good idea to explain the source code provided. It is also a good idea to have copy explaining the details of each part of the book and the technical algorithms and problems covered in each chapter.


The headline can be the book title and subtitle, like amazon.

A better approach is to call out the problem solved by the book.

The sales page must sell

## Things to Avoid

* Don't just put up an amazon-like sales page. Amazon customers are there to buy and have already been sold on the book off-site. This sales page must do the selling.
* Don't copy the sales pages of other developers selling technical books. They don't know about sales and marketing, by and large.
* Don't get to salesy. Developers like being sold, just like everyone else, but it cannot be too obvious with obnoxious sales copy.
* Don't use a short sales page. Developers want lots of detail, want lots of emotion, lots of reasons to buy. Spend days writing the copy.
* Don't have copy errors. Read the page aloud. Use TTS. Pay an editor.
* Don't follow rules of good English. You may need to use capital letters, underlining, bolding, ellipsis and more in unconventional ways to make the copy easily scanned.

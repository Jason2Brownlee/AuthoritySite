# Courage

It's scary.

All of it.

Putting work out in public.

Releasing books to the world.

Figuring something out and showing how to the very next moment.

* There will be bugs.
* There will be typos.
* There will be mistakes.

Expect them. Do you're best to minimize their occurrence.

* You will be wrong.
* You will be embarrassed.
* You will look the fool.

Accept it.

It is okay to feel that watery feeling deep down in your stomach.

It means you are moving in the right direction.

You are doing the hard thing that stops everyone else that follows.

Walk out on that ledge.

Take the lead.

Do that hard things and feel the fear.

Courage is doing the hard things anyway, even though you feel the fear.

Never not do the thing that needs to be done because you're afraid.

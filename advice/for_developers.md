# Marketing to developers is really hard and different

Developers are different:

* They are really smart.
* They want to learn things.
* They want results, quick results.
* They want useful content.
* They want to see/play with the product first.
* They don't spend money unless there is obvious value.

They hate things:

* They don't want popups.
* They don't want ads.
* They don't want blog spam.
* They don't like marketing.

Everything must be clear and truthful. Authentic.

Give!

Focus on giving them things that help.

* Engage their curiosity.
* Help them learn, quickly.
* Help them get results.
* Show them results are possible and real.

Show code and code output, shows that code works.

Use landing pages instead of popups.

No obvious ads.

Treat the API as a product.

Show how to use all of it. Typical case, edge case, etc.

There are different types of devs and they have different problems, for example:

- Code snippets might be for junior developers.
- Case studies might be for senior developers.

Older developers may need a book.
Younger developers may need a video.

Other ideas:

* Developers like a very fast website
* Developers hate popups
* Developers hate modal
* Developers hate ads
* Developers like clean and simple design
* Developers like free things, even with an email
* Developers are curious
* Developers want working code
* Developers need proof that code works
* Developers need proof that other people are buying/using/are around
* Developers mostly ignore the sidebar
* Developers click links in content, e.g. in-content ads
* Developers are lazy
* Developers will copy paste code from a tutorial
* Developers don't read tutorials (but google does)
* Developers want to learn from an expert
* Developers don't like gated content
* Developers don't like being contacted

No one wants to follow a company.

We want to get help from real people that have verifiable experience.

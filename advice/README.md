# Authority Site Advice

## On A Book of Advice

I did write a book of my experiences building, running and selling an authority site.

At this stage, I'm keeping it private, e.g. for my sons when the grow up, mainly because it's filled with verbatim emails and real business numbers, etc.

I may release it later.


## On Taking Advice

I've had tens of coffees where people "pick my brain" about building an authority site business.

I've sent hundreds of emails with book recommendations to people asking how to get started.

As far as I know, zero people I have advised started anything.

I don't think people take advice. Honestly, I think this project is only useful to those who have already started building an authority site business or are already running one. I don't know how to motivate someone who is interested, to actually start.

But I might be wrong. If only one person is inspired to dive in, then this guide was worth it.

Probably the real goal of this project is so that I can talk to myself. There is so much stuff to keep in your head to do "authority sites" well that I need to constantly remind myself of things. Re-reading books and adding notes to this project does that for me.

## Did Any Of This Help?

I'd love to hear if any of this helped you in some small way.

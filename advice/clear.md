# Clear

Almost nothing is clear. It's all a big ball of mud.

A visitor lands on one tutorial.

* Is the problem clear?
* Is the solution clear?

What else?

* Is the brand clear?
* Is it clear they are in the right place for people like them?

What else?

* Is the lead magnet clear and obvious?
* Is the related product clear?

If they visit the tutorial and get help and were interview later, would they:

* Be able to tell you the name of the site?
* Be able to tell you if there was a lead magnet available or not?
* Be able to tell you if there was a book available on the topic or not?

Don't hide everything.

Put it up front and out in the open.

Make it crystal clear.

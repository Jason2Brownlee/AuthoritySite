# Best at X for Y people

Forget everything else.

Focus on being the best at X for Y people.

Where X is the topic and Y people are the audience you serve.

* What do they need help with?
* What is keeping them up at night?
* What materials would be invaluable to them?
* How could the site be so amazing that they would pay just to use it?

Get obsessed with X from Y people's perspective.

Talk to Y people all the time.

Consume everything about X in existence.

Be world class at X.

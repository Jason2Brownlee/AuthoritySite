# Teardowns

Improve the site using ideas from teardowns of other sites.

Find other authority sites that target developers and do a teardown.

This might mean :

* mapping the topics and subtopics of the chosen niche
* mapping the sales funnel for a product
* mapping social media strategy
* reviewing a sales page
* reviewing a product
* reviewing on-page or off-page seo
* reviewing the presentation of content

The goal is to identify elements that work, elements that don't and elements that are missing.

The teardowns will provide the basis of experiments to try on your own authority site.

A teardown should be performed at least once per month.

Ideally, you would find a way to leverage the tear down, such as:

* turn it into content
* make suggestions and use it as the start of a relationship

# Build Out a Catalog

Each day adds to the asset, the website. Each tutorial makes it bigger and more valuable.

It is the same with products.

You are creating a library or catalog that will pay you for years, maybe the rest of your life if you don't sell.

Especially if you keep things updated and pick a topic where the information will be needed for 10 or 20 years.

Focus on the catalog, not just the next book.

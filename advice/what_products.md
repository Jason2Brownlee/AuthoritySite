# What Products?

What products should you make?

What messaging should you use?

Experiment

Don't guess. experiment.

Imagine you didn't have the site.

Now imagine you had a friend who had your site.

It had n thousand page views per month.

They will let you run ads on the site for free for a month.

What would you do?

What ideas would you test?

Recall, you don't need to advertise real products. You can advertise product ideas and see which get the most clicks.

You can also test messaging ideas for those products and see which get the most clicks.

This could be a/b tested or it could be randomized.

Ads could be anywhere at all on the site.

* In the sidebar
* In the navigation menu
* A banner
* A pop-up
* In the content
* After the content
* In the footer
* On the homepage
* ...

How would you approach this?

List all the products you can think of.

For example:

* courses
* books
* coaching
* services
* ...

List all the approaches for messaging you can think of.

For example:

* learn the topic
* learn a subtopic
* solve general problem
* solve a general problem
* transform from a to b
* ...

In fact, messaging is all you get to test in an ad.

Test lots of things

* test different ad copy
* test ads that look like ads
* test ads that look like content

Products can be tested on landing pages.

Collect email addresses so you can follow-up and ask questions, like:

* Why do you want this?
* What outcome do you want to achieve?
* What else have you tried?

Get on calls with people that leave their email address. Ask the questions via video, rather than email.

Now, you have this site.
It's not a thought experiment.
Run these experiments.

Think bigger.

Why not test messaging with dedicated tutorials.

Basically editorials on a specific problem or perspective on the field.

Write them and push them where the community hang out. See if they resonate.

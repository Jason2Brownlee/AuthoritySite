# Confusion

Readers are confused.

* They have a technical problem.
* They arrive on your site.
* They just want to solve their technical problem right now.

They do not want to be hammered with ideas, popups, and opt-ins.

Each page should have one call to action (CTA).
Having more than one CTA is confusing.

One button to click to go a level deeper.

Each page should have one topic or idea.

One category.
One problem.
One solution.

One thing to do to get a result.

Alleviate the confusion.
Don't add to it.

Be the shortest path from problem to solution on the internet for your audience.

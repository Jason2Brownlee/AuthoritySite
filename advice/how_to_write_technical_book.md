Hi XXX,

So you want to write a technical book.

First, get your mindset right.

You don't need many customers, you need a small group of fans that are into whatever you're doing.

Nothing you do is original, just share what you know that will help other people.

Work/write in public, share your process, even all the content of your book as blog posts.

# Work Every Day

Work on the business every day.

It's easy on the days when things are going well.

But you must also work on the days when things are not so easy.

* Even on birthdays and holidays.
* Even on days when you don't feel well.

Every day.

Do one thing that makes the site better.

Do one thing that makes a tutorial better.

Do one thing that helps the readers. Serve them in the smallest way.

We don't take days off from brushing our teeth.

We also don't days off making the business just the tiniest bit better.

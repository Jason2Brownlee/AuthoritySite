# Website

Do not write a custom content management system (CMS) in your favorite programming language.

Use WordPress.

The site will be optimized for SEO and google by default and additional functionality can be added by a large community of plugin-ins.



## Use a Theme

Use a paid theme with support and updates from a well known provider.

If the focus is technical, e.g. code tutorials for developers, then focus on readability.

Large readable font.

Little clutter.

* Add support for pretty math.
* Add support for pretty code listings.

Consider a plugin for SEO, although trying to dial in titles and snippets is probably a waste of time.





## Architecture

There is a study of website architecture, called information design or information architecture.

The most common site architecture is by category and then pages.

The site is a topic, each category is a subtopic and each page is a specific problem and solution.

A page belongs to one subtopic or category.

There is a single page that represents the hub for each subtopic, e.g. a category page.

Historically this was a list of all posts in the category.

A better approach is to have a large page that explains the topic from a high level and links out to all of the relevant pages.

This patter is called the "silo method" for authority site design.



## Site Pages

Each page has one job.

There are a few main sections to the site, they are:

* Homepage
* Start Here
* Blog
* Products
* FAQ
* About


## Content

The idea is to have a answer for every possible question that a read might ask.

An answer to a technical question will be a blog post.

An answer to a prospect or customer support question will be a FAQ answer.

If there is a question without an answer, then a piece of content must be created to handle it.

If one person asked a question in a comment or via email, then there were probably 10x or 100x people with the same question that did not ask.


## Topic Extensions

(e.g. topics to cover in the future)

I made the mistake of recording these questions in a text file and most were never liberated.

I should have written a piece of content on each or paid to have a piece of content written on each.

I did not want to balloon the number of categories, to write books on topic I was not ready to write about.

Not sure how to balance this fact yet.

Perhaps create stubs of topics/categories that could be expanded in the future.

Perhaps use a catch-all category for these pieces until the decision to double down was made later.


## Homepage

The home page is a squeeze page.

It's job is it to get the visitor onto your email list.

Secondarily, it provides credibility. This might be testimonials, reviews and logos of appearances or customers.

It also sends a clear signal of who the site is for.

Navigation off to other parts of the site is not as important.



## Start Here

The job of this page is to connect the user with a problem to the topic with the solution.

It provides guidance on where to go on the site to get help.

It might provide a summary of each major section of the site.

It might be a catalog of categories or hub-pages.


## Blog

Each blog post is a tutorial that answers one specific technical question.

For example:

* How to get a result with a technique.
* What are the best resources for a method.
* A gentle introduction to a method.

The site architecture is top level topic which is a basket of subtopics.

Each blog post belongs to one category which represents the subtopic under the topic.

The side bar is only used for blog post tutorials is used as advertisement space.

* Advertise the most relevant lead magnet for the topic.
* Advertise the most relevant blog posts on the topic.
* Advertise the most relevant product on the topic.

The end of the tutorial can do a similar job. That is advertise the most relevant tutorials to read next and most relevant product to purchase.

Each tutorial must include in-content ads specific to the topic.

At the start of the tutorial is an ad for the product that will solve their problem.

Half-way through the content is an ad for an email course that will solve their problem, in case they did not purchase the product





## Products

The job of this page is to connect a reader with a product that will solve their problem.

It is a product catalog.

Each product has a sales page, the job of which is to convert a reader into a customer.

Each product solves one problem for the customer.


## FAQ

The job of this page is to answer a specific question for the reader.

It might be a specific technical question, in which case the FAQ will drive them to a blog post.

It might be specific meta question about the site.

It might be a prospect question about the products.

It might be a customer support question.

This page must be added to each time there is a question from a customer/prospect that does not have an answer.


## About

The about page is a squeeze page.

It has the secondary job of connecting the reader to the author.

It tells the hero's journey of the author from where the reader is now to where they want to be and how the author can guide them on the same journey.


## Other

The site header should be minimal.

It must include brand information such as logo and a tag line that filters readers. The site is only for a specific type of reader looking to make a specific transition.

The navigation in minimal and only includes 5-7 elements.

There must be a search box for the site.

## Side Bar

The sidebar is only used on the blog content.

It must connect the reader with the author and their mission.

The reader must know they are in the right place and that the site author or team will help them.

It can provide a soft call to action to never miss new content, e.g. follow on social or join the newsletter.

Primary it suggests the most relevant content to read next and advertises the most relevant product to purchase.

Perhaps the sidebar can be removed and the tutorial itself can do this job.

## Footer

The site footer must include credibility information such as the business information, business owner, and address, as well as standard links to privacy policy, disclaimer, and sitemap.

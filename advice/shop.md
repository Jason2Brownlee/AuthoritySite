* It's a shop

Think about this:

There is an infinite mall or shopping center.
You occupy one little shop focused on one tiny topic.
People wonder by the shop front.
Some people wonder in, interested in the topic at some level.
You offer products and services to help.
Most people walk out.
Some look over your products, talk to the staff, make a purchase.

Your website is like a small stall in an infinite mall.

* What do you want this shop to look like?
* What do you want it feel like as a customer?
* What products do you offer?
* What advice do you offer?
* If they can walk out with a show bag of goodies / merch, what do you offer?
* If you were to call them up later, what would you say?

Design this experience! This is your site.
